THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to Council Directive 91/414/EEC of 15 July 1991 concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market (1), as last amended by Commission Directive 95/35/EC (2), and in particular Article 18(2) thereof,
it is necessary to indicate, in Annexes II and III to Directive 91/414/EEC, to the applicants as precisely as possible any details on the required information, such as the circumstances, conditions and technical protocols under which certain data have to be generated ; whereas these provisions should be introduced as soon as available in order to permit applicants to use them in the preparation of their files ;
it is also possible to introduce now more precision with regard to the data requirements concerning fate and behaviour in the environment of the plant protection product provided for in Section 9 of Part A of Annex III.
Directive 91/414/EEC is amended as follows :
Part A of Annex III, the section headed '9. Fate and behaviour in the environment' is replaced by Annex II hereto.
They shall immediately inform the Commission thereof.
The procedure for such reference shall be adopted by the Member States.
This Directive is addressed to the Member States.
The information provided, taken together with that for one or more preparations containing the active substance, must be sufficient to pemit an assessment of the fate and behaviour of the active substance in the environment, and of the non-target species likely to be at risk from exposure to the active substance, its metabolites, degradation and reaction products, where they are of toxicological or environmental significance.
decide whether, or not, the active substance can be included in Annex I,
classify the active substance as to hazard ;
predict the disribution, fate, and behaviour in the environment of the active substance and relevant metabolites, degradation and reaction products as well as the times courses involved,
identify measures necesary to minimize contamination of the environment and impact on non-target species.
Where testing is done using active substance the material used should be of that specification that will be used in the manufacture of preparations to be authorized except where radio-labelled material is used.
Where radio-labelled test material is used, radio-labels should be positioned at sites (one or more as necessary), to facilitate elucidation of metabolic and degradative pathways and to facilitate investigation of the distribution of the active substance and of its metabolite, reaction and degradation products in the environment.
Before such studies are performed the information from the Sections 5 and 6 has to be taken into account.
Full details of the statistical anaylsis should be reported (e.g. all point estimates should be given with confidence intervals, exact p-values should be given rather than stating significant/ non significant).
All relevant information on the type and the properties of the soil used in the studies, including pH, organic carbon content, cation exchange capacity, particle size distribution and water holding capacity, particle size distribution and water holding capacity at pF = 0 and pF = 2,5 has to be reported in accordance with relevant ISO or other international standards.
It is recommended to use as much as possible the same soils throughout all laboratory soil studies.
- they cover a range of organic carbon content, particle size distribution and pH values ; and
Soils used must, wherever possible, be freshly sampled.
Soils stored for longer periods of time can only be used for adsorption/desorption studies.
Soils should be collected and handled in accordance with ISO 10381-6 (Soil quality - Sampling - Guidance on the collection, handling and storage of soil for the assessment of mt"crobial processes in the laboratory).
Field studies should be carried out in conditions as close to normal agricultural practice as possible on a range of soil types and climatic conditions representative of the area(s) of use.
Route and rate of degradation
identify, where feasable, the relative importance of the types of process involved (balance between chemical and biological degradation),
identify where possible also individual components present which account for less than 10 % of the amount of active substance added,
permit the soil residue of concern and to which non-target species are or may be exposed, to be defined.
These non-extractable residues are not considered to include fragments through metabolic pathways leading to natural products.
The degradation pathway or pathways must be reported for one soil.
volatile compounds other than CO2,
The investigation of degradation pathways must include all feasible steps to characterise and quantify non-extractable residues formed after 100 days when exceeding 70 % of the applied dose of the active substance.
justification must be provided where the compounds involved are not characterized.

Test conditions and test guideline
soil photolysis study must be reported unless it can be justified that deposition of the active substance at the soil surface is unlikely to occur.
The soil degradation studies should provide best possible estimates of the time taken for degradation of 50 % and 90 % (DT50lab and DT90lab), of the active substance, and of relevant metabolites, degradation and reaction products under laboratory conditions.
The rate of aerobic degradation of the active substance in three soil types additional to that referred to in paragraph 7.1.1.1.1. must be reported.
The duration of the study is normally 120 days except if more than 90 % of the active substance is degraded before that period expires.
The rate of anaerobic degrad tion of the active substance must be carried out in the soil used in the anaerobic study performed according to point 7.1.1.1.2.
Similar studies for one soil must be reported for all relevant metobolites, degradation and reaction products which occur in soil and which at any time during the studies account for more than 10 % of the amount of active substance added, except where their DT50 values were able to be determined from the results of the degradation studies with the active substance.
Where relevant, information on relevant metabolites, degradation and reaction products must be reported.
Where plant protection products containing the active substance are intended to be used in cold climatic conditions, the tests have to be conducted where DT50lab, determined at 10 Â°C and at a moisture content of the soil related to a pF value of 2 to 2,5 (suction pressure) is greater than 90 days.
The maximum duration of the studies is 24 months.
Soil residue studies must be reported where DT50lab is greater than one-third of the period between the application and harvest and where absorption by the succeeding crop is possible, except where soil residues at sowing or planting of a succeeding crop can be reliably estimated from the data of the soil dissipation studies or where it can be justified that these residues can not be phytotoxic to or leave unacceptable residues in rotational crops.
The tests should provide sufficient data to evaluate the possibility of accumulation of residues of the active substance and of relevant metabolites, degradation and reaction products.
Long term field studies must be done on two relevant soils and involve multiple applications.
The data and information provided, together with other relevant data and information, should be sufficient to establish the absorption coefficient of the active substance and of relevant metabolites, degradation and reaction products.
Studies on the active substance must be reported for four soil types.
The test should provide sufficient data to evaluate the mobility and leaching potential of the active substance and if possible of relevant metabolities, degradation and reaction products.
The test should provide sufficient data to estimate the mobility and leaching potential of relevant metabolites, degradation and reaction products.
where the nature and manner of use of preparations containing the active substance, preclude soil contamination such as uses on stored products or wound healing treatments for trees, or
The period(s) of ageing should be determined from inspection of the degradation patterns of active substance and metabolites to ensure that a relevant spectrum of metabolites is present at the time of leaching.
The test should provide data on :
Expert judgement will be necessary to decide whether lysimeter studies or field leaching studies should be carried out, taking into account the results of degradation and other mobility studies and the predicted environmental concentrations in groundwater (PECGW), calculated in accordance with the provisions of Annex III, Section 9.
Great care is necessary in design of both experimental installations and individual studies, to ensure that results obtained can be used for assessment purposes.
Water percolating from soil columns must be analyzed at suitable intervals, while residues in plant material must be determined at harvest.
Intermediate sampling must be avoided, since removal of plants (except for harvesting according to normal agricultural practice) and soil cross influences the leaching process.
The minimal depth of the lysimeters should be 100 cm ; their maximal depth should be 130 cm.
Soil temperatures must be similar to those pertaining in the field.
When during the study the soil has to be disturbed for agricultural reasons it must not be disturbed deeper than 25 cm.
If soil cracking is observed during the study this must be fully described.
The placement of these devices in the soil should not result in preferential flow paths.
The information and data provided , taken together with that provided for one or more preparations containing the active substance, and other relevant information, should be sufficient to establish, or permit estimation of :
potential for contamination of surface water and groundwater.
identify the relative importance of the types of processes involved (balance between chemical and biological degradation),
establish the relative proportions of the components present and their distribution as between water, including suspended particles, and sediment, and
The test must always be performed for relevant metabolites, degradation and reaction products which account at any time for more than 10 % of the amount of active substance added unless sufficient information on their degradation is available from the test performed in accordance with point 2.9.1.

The test must always be performed unless it is not required under the provisions of Annex VI to Directive 67/548/EEC for the classification of the active substance.
The test must be reported unless it can be justified that contamination of surface water will not occur.
Transformation rates in the saturated zone of active substances and of relevant metabolites, degra dation and reaction products can provide useful information on the fate of these substances in the groundwater.
Before performing these studies the applicant shall seek the agreement of the competent authorities on the type of study to be performed.
In the light of the chemical composition of residues occurring in soil, water or air, resulting from use, or proposed use, of a plant protection product containing the active substance a proposal for the definition of the residue must be submitted, taking account of both the levels found and their toxicological and environmental significance.
The information provided, taken together with that for the active substance as provided for in Annex II, must be sufficient to permit an assessment of the fate and behaviour of the plant protection product in the environment, and of the non-target species likely to be at risk from exposure to it.
predict the distribution, fate, and behaviour in the environment as well as the time courses involved,
identify measures necessary to minimize contamination of the environment and impact on non-target species.
Full details of the statistical analysis should be reported (e.g. all point estimates should be given with confidence intervals, exact p-values should be given rather than stating significant/non significant).
Justified estimates must be made of the expected concentrations of the active substance and relevant metabolites, degradation and reaction products, in soil, groundwater, surface water and air, following use as proposed or already occurring.
For the purposes of the estimation of such concentrations the following definitions apply :
The level of residues in the top layer of the soil and to which non-target soil organisms may be exposed (acute and chronic exposure).
The level of residues, in surface water to which non-target aquatic organisms may be exposed (acute and chronic exposure).
The level of residues in groundwater.
The level of residues in air, to which man, animals and other non-target organisms may be exposed (acute and chronic exposure).
useful approach for these estimations is provided in the EPPO schemes for environmental risk assessment (1).
When models are used for estimation of predicted environmental concentrations they must :
where possible be reliably validated with measurements carried out under circumstances relevant for the use of the model,
The information provided must, where relevant, include that referred to in Annex II, Part A, point 7:
The soil degradation studies should provide best possible estimates of the time taken for degradation of 50 and 90 % (DT50lab and DT90lab) of the active substance under laboratory conditions.
This extrapolation is, for example, not possible for slow release formulations.
The soil dissipation studies should provide best-possible estimates of the time taken for dissipation of 50 and 90 % (DT50f and DT90f), of the active substance under field conditions.
The dissipation and behaviour of plant protection products in soil must be investigated unless it is possible to extrapolate from data obtained on the active substance and relevant metabolites, degradation and reaction products in accordance to the requirements of Annex II, point 7.1.1.2.
The same provisions as provided under the corresponding paragraph of Annex II, point 7.1.1.2.2. apply.
Soil residue studies must be reported unless it is possible to extrapolate from data obtained on the active substance and relevant metabolites, degradation and reaction products in accordance with the requirements of Annex II, point 7.1.1.2.2.
The test should provide sufficient data to evaluate the mobility and leaching potential of the active substance and relevant metabolites, degradation and reaction products.

Expert judgement will be necessary to decide whether field leaching studies or lysimeter studies should be carried out, taking into account the results of degradation and mobility studies and the calculated PECS.
These studies must be performed unless it is possible to extrapolate from data obtained on the active substance and relevant metabolites, degradation and reaction products in accordance with the requirements of Annex II, point 7.1.3.
Estimation of expected concentrations in soil
The factors to be considered in making PECS estimations relate to direct and indirect application to soil, drift, run off, and leaching and include processes such as volatilization, adsorption, hydrolysis, photolysis, aerobic and anaerobic degradation.
Where ground cover is present at time of application, it is to be assumed that 50 % (minimum) of the applied dose reaches the soil surface unless actual experimental data give more specific information.

Fate and behaviour in air
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission ( 1 ),
Acting in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 189c of the Treaty (3),
Whereas the International Safety Management Code providing for the safe operation of ships and for pollution prevention, hereinafter referred to as the 'ISM Code', was adopted by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) through Assembly Resolution A.741(18) of 4 November 1993 in the presence of the Member States and, through its incorporation into the International Convention on the Safety of Life at Sea 1974, will apply to ro-ro passenger vessels from 1 July 1998;
safety of human life at sea may be effectively enhanced by applying the ISM Code strictly and on a mandatory basis;
in its resolution of 22 December 1994 on the safety of roll-on/roll-off passenger ferries (4), the Council invited the Commission to submit a proposal on the advance mandatory application of the ISM Code to all regular roll-on/roll-off passenger ferry services operating to or from European ports, in compliance with international law;
action at Community level is the best way to ensure advance mandatory enforcement of the provisions of the ISM Code and effective control of its application, while avoiding distortion of competition between different Community ports and ro-ro ferries; whereas only a regulation, which is of direct applicability, can ensure such enforcement; whereas advance implementation requires that the Regulation be applicable as from 1 July 1996;
the safety of ships is the primary responsibility of flag States; whereas Member States can ensure compliance with adequate safety management rules by ferries flying their flag and companies operating them; whereas the only way to ensure the safety of all ro-ro ferries, irrespective of their flag, operating or wishing to operate on a regular service from their ports is for the Member States to require effective compliance with safety rules as a condition for operating on a regular service from their ports;
it is necessary to identify the requirements under which the provisions of the ISM Code are enforced and to define the conditions for the issue and verification of the document of compliance and of the safety management certificate;
a Member State must have the possibility of suspending the operation of certain ro-ro ferries from its ports where it considers that there is a risk of serious danger to safety of life or property or the environment, subject to a decision to be taken in the framework of a regulatory committee, to which the Member States must conform;
the rapid introduction of these safety rules raises specific technical and administative problems for Greece because of the very large number of companies established in Greece operating ferries under the Greek flag and exclusively between Greek ports; whereas a derogation of limited duration to cover this situation should therefore be granted bearing in mind in addition that regular passenger and ferry services between Greek ports have been excluded until 1 January 2004 from the freedom to provide services granted by Council Regulation (EEC) No 3577/92 of 7 December 1992 applying the principle of freedom to provide services to maritime transport within Member States (maritime cabotage) (2),
the establishment and proper maintenance of shipboard and shore-based safety management systems by companies, and
For the purpose of this Regulation and with a view to the implementation of the ISM Code:
regular service' means a series of ro-ro ferry crossings operated so as to serve traffic between the same two or more points, either:
with crossings so reguiar or frequent that they constitute a recognizable systematic series;
recognized organization' means a body recognized in compliance with the provisions of Directive 94/57/EC;
administration' means the Government of the State whose flag the ro-ro ferry is entitled to fly;
safety management certificate' means the certificate issued to ro-ro ferries in conformity with paragraph
The Regulation shall apply to all companies, operating at least one ro-ro ferry to or from a port of a Member State of the Community on a regular service regardless of its flag.
By way of derogation from paragraph 1, companies operating a ro-ro ferry or ferries on a regular service exclusively in sheltered waters between ports situated in the same Member State may defer compliance with the provisions of this Regulation until 1 July 1997.
For the purposes of paragraph 1, Member States may only authorize, or rely upon, fully or in part, a recognized organization.
Prior to such issue, the Member States shall consult the administration of the States whose flag the ro-ro ferries of that company are entitled to fly, if that administration is not that of the issuing Member State.
The safety management certificate shall only be valid for five years from the date of its issue, provided always that an intermediate verification takes place at least every months or more frequently in order to confirm the proper functioning of the safety management system and to confirm that possible modifications introduced since the latest verification satisfy the provisions of the ISM Code.
Member State shall recognize the documents of compliance and safety management certificates issued by, or on behalf of, the administrations of third countries if it is satisfied that they demonstrate compliance with the provisions of this Regulation.
Member States shall satisfy themselves that all companies providing regular ro-ro ferry services to or from their ports comply with the provisions of this Regulation.
In the above circumstances the following procedure shall apply:
the Commission shall  examine  whether  the suspension is justified for reasons of serious danger to safety and the environment;
ln order to take account of the general terms of the ISM Code, the Commission shall review the implementation of this Regulation three years after its entry into force and propose any appropriate measures.
the definition of the 'ISM Code' in Article 2;
the definition of 'recognized organization' in Article 2;
The Commission shall be assisted by the Committee established by ArticleÂ· 12 (1) of Council Directive 93/75/EEC (I).
The Committee shall deliver its opinion on the draft within a time limit which the chairman may lay down according to the urgency of the matter.
The votes of the representatives of the Member States within the committee shall be weighted in the manner set out in that Article.
The Commission shall adopt the measures envisaged if they are in accordance with the opinion of the committee.
The Council shall act by a qualified majority.
Council Directive 93/75/EEC of 1.3 September 1993 concerning minimum requirements for vessels bound for or leaving Community ports and carrying dangerous or polluting goods
It shall be applicable as from 1 July 1996.

Safety and pollution prevention management requirements
Safety and environmental protection policy 77
Reports and analysis of non-conformities, accidents and hazardous occurrences 79
Company verification, review and evaluation 80
The Assembly adopted Resolution A.443(XI) by which it invited alll governments to take the necessary steps to safeguard the shipmaster in the proper discharge of his responsibilities with regard to maritime safety and the protection of the marine environment.
Recognizing that no two shipping companies or shipowners are the same, and that ships operate under a wide range of different conditions, the Code is based on general principles and objectives.
Clearly, different levels of management, whether shore-based or at sea, will require varying levels of knowledge and awareness of the items outlined.
In matters of safety and pollution prevention it is the commitment, competence, attitudes and motivation of individuals at all levels that determines the end result.
Company means the owner of the ship or any other organization or person such as the manager or the bareboat charterer, who has assumed the responsibility for operation of the ship from the shipowner and who on assuming such responsibility has agreed to take over all the duties and responsibility imposed by the Code.
The objectives of the Code are to ensure safety at sea, prevention of human injury or loss of life, and avoidance of damage to the environment, in particular, to the marine environment, and to property.
provide for safe practices in ship operation and a safe working environment;
continuously improve safety management skills of personnel ashore and aboard ships, including preparing for emergencies related both to safety and environmental protection.
compliance with mandatory rules and regulations; and
The requirements of this Code may be applied to all ships.
Every company should develop, implement and maintain a safety management system (SMS) which includes the following functional requirements:
instructions and procedures to ensure safe operation of ships and protection of the environment in compliance with relevant international and flag State legislation;
procedures for reporting accidents and non-conformities with the provisions of this Code;
procedures for internal audits and management reviews.
The company should establish a safety and environmental protection policy which describes how the objectives, given in paragraph 1.2, will be achieved.
If the entity who is responsible for the operation of the ship is other than the owner, the owner must report the full name and details of such entity to the administration.
The company is responsible for ensuring that adequate resources and shore-based support are provided to enable the designated person or persons to carry out their functions.
The responsibility and authority of the designated person or persons should include monitoring the safety and pollution prevention aspects of the operation of each ship and to ensure that adequate resources and shore-based support are applied, as required.
implementing the safety and environmental protection policy of the company;
issuing appropriate orders and instructions in a clear and simple manner;
reviewing the SMS and reporting its deficiencies to the shore-based management.
The company should establish in the SMS that the master has the overriding authority and the responsibility to make decisions with respect to safety and pollution prevention and to request the company's assistance as may be necessary.
fully conversant with the company's SMS; and
The company should ensure that each ship is manned with qualified, certificated and medically fit seafarers in accordance with national and international requirements.
Instructions which are essential to be provided to sailing should be identified and documented.
The company should establish and maintain procedures for identifying any training which may be required in support of the SMS and ensure that such training is provided for all personnel concerned.
The company should ensure that the ship's personnel are able to communicate effectively in the execution of their duties related to the SMS.
The company should establish procedures for the preparation of plans and instructions for key shipboard operations concerning the safety of the ship and the prevention of pollution.
The company should establish procedures to identify, describe and respond to potential emergency shipboard situations.
The SMS should provide for measures ensuring that the company's organization can respond at any time to hazards, accidents and emergency situations involving its ships.
The SMS should include procedures ensuring that non-conformities, accidents and hazardous situations are reported to the company, investigated and analysed with the objective of improving safety and pollution prevention.
MAINTENANCE OF THE SHIP AND EQUIPMENT
In meeting these requirements the company should ensure that:
any non-conformity is reported with its possible cause, if known;
records of these activities are maintained.
The SMS should provide for specific measures aimed at promoting the reliability of such equipment or systems.
The inspections mentioned in 10.2 as well as the measures referred to m 10.3 should be integrated in the ship's operational maintenance/routine.
The company should ensure that:
changes to documents are reviewed and approved by authorized personnel; and
The documents used to describe and implement the SMS may be referred to as the 'safety management manual'.
Each ship should carry on board all documentation relevant to that ship.
The company should carry out internal safety audits to verify whether safety and pollution prevention activities comply with the SMS.
The audits and possible corrective actions should be carried out in accordance with documented procedures.
The results of the audits and reviews should be brought to the attention of all personnel having responsibility in the area involved.
The ship should be operated by a company which is issued a document of compliance relevant to that ship.
This document should be accepted as evidence that the company is capable of complying with the requirements of the Code.
A certificate, called a safety management certificate, should be issued to a ship by the administration or organization recognized by the administration.
The administration or an organization recognized by the administration should periodically verify the proper functioning of the ship's SMS as approved.
amending Council Directive 93/6/EEC on the capital adequacy of investment firms and credit institutions
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular the first and third sentences of Article 57(2),
Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 189b of the Treaty (4),
the perpetration of serious fraud by certain commodity futures traders is of growing concern to the Community and a threat to the image and integrity of the futures trading business;
Council Directive 93/6/EEC of 15 March 1993 on the capital adequacy of investment firms and credit institutions (6) lays down a standardised method for the calculation of capital requirements for market risks incurred by investment firms and credit institutions; whereas institutions have developed their own risk-management systems (internal models), designed to measure more accurately than the standardised method the market risks incurred by investment firms and credit institutions; whereas the use of more accurate methods of measuring risks should be encouraged;
it is appropriate that competent authorities may allow margin requirements for exchange-traded futures and options, and on a transitional basis for cleared over-the-counter derivatives of the same nature, to be used as substitutes for the capital requirement calculated for such instruments in accordance with this Directive, provided that this does not lead to a capital requirement which is lower than the capital requirement calculated according to the other methods prescribed in this Directive; whereas the application of this principle does not require that the equivalence between such margin requirements and the capital requirements calculated according to the other methods prescribed in this Directive must be continually verified by the institutions applying this principle;
for the purpose of calculating market-risk-capital requirements, positions in gold and gold derivatives should be treated in a similar fashion to foreign-exchange positions;
this Directive is in accordance with the work of an international forum of banking supervisors on the supervisory treatment of market risk and of positions in commodities and commodity derivatives;
this Directive is the most appropriate means of attaining the objectives sought and does not go beyond what is necessary to achieve those objectives,
point 6(a) and the introductory phrase and subpoints (i) and (ii) of point 6(b) shall be replaced by the following:
the exposures due to the unsettled transactions, free deliveries and over-the-counter (OTC) derivative instruments referred to in paragraphs 1, 2, 3 and 5 of Annex II, the exposures due to repurchase agreements and securities and commodities lending which are based on securities or commodities included in the trading book as defined in (a) referred to in paragraph 4 of Annex II, those exposures due to reverse repurchase agreements and securities-borrowing and commodities-borrowing transactions described in the same paragraph, provided the competent authorities so approve, which meet either conditions (i), (ii), (iii) and (v) or conditions(iv) and (v) as follows:
the collateral is adjusted in order to take account of material changes in the value of the securities or commodities involved in the agreement or transaction in question, according to a rule acceptable to the competent authorities;
âwarrantâ shall mean a security which gives the holder the right to purchase an underlying at a stipulated price until or at the warrants expiry date.
âstock financingâ shall mean positions where physical stock has been sold forward and the cost of funding has been locked in until the date of the forward sale;
ârepurchase agreementâ and âreverse repurchase agreementâ shall mean any agreement in which an institution or its counter-party transfers securities or commodities or guaranteed rights relating to title to securities or commodities where that guarantee is issued by a recognised exchange which holds the rights to the securities or commodities and the agreement does not allow an institution to transfer or pledge a particular security or commodity to more than one counter-party at one time, subject to a commitment to repurchase them (or substituted securities or commodities of the same description) at a specified price on a future date specified, or to be specified, by the transferor, being a repurchase agreement for the institution selling the securities or commodities and a reverse repurchase agreement for the institution buying them;
âsecurities or commodities lendingâ and âsecurities or commodities borrowingâ shall mean any transaction in which an institution or its counter-party transfers securities or commodities against appropriate collateral subject to a commitment that the borrower will return equivalent securities or commodities at some future date or when requested to do so by the transferor, that transaction being securities or commodities lending for the institution transferring the securities or commodities and being securities or commodities borrowing for the institution to which they are transferred.
first subparagraph, points (i) and (ii) shall be replaced by the following:
the capital requirements, calculated in accordance with Annexes III and VII and, as appropriate, Annex VIII, for all of their business activities.
Notwithstanding paragraph 1, those institutions which calculate the capital requirements for their trading-book business in accordance with Annexes I and II, and as appropriate Annex VIII, shall monitor and control their large exposures in accordance with Directive 92/121/EEC subject to the modifications laid down in Annex VI to this Directive;
Where the rights of waiver provided for in paragraphs 7 and 9 are not exercised, the competent authorities may, for the purpose of calculating the capital requirements set out in Annexes I and VIII and the exposures to clients set out in Annex VI on a consolidated basis, permit positions in the trading book of one institution to offset positions in the trading book of another institution according to the rules set out in Annexes I, VI and VIII.
They may also allow commodities positions in one institution to offset commodities positions in another institution in accordance with the rules set out in Annex VII and/or Annex VIII.
The competent authorities shall oblige institutions to report to them immediately any case in which their counter-parties in repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements or securities and commodities-lending and securities and commodities-borrowing transactions default on their obligations.
Such report shall also describe the way that institutions meet those of conditions (i) to (v) in Article 2(6)(b) that apply to them, in particular condition (v).
If the Commission concludes on the basis of this report and other information that further safeguards are needed to prevent abuse, it shall make appropriate proposals.
Until 31 December 2006, Member States may authorise their institutions to use the minimum spread, carry and outright rates set out in the following table instead of those indicated in paragraphs 13, 14, 17 and 18 of Annex VII provided that the institutions, in the opinion of their competent authorities:
are not yet in a position to use internal models for the purpose of calculating the capital requirement on commodities risk in accordance with Annex VIII.
Annexes I, II, III and V shall be amended, and Annexes VII and VIII added in accordance with the Annex to this Directive.
They shall forthwith inform the Commission thereof.
The methods of making such reference shall be laid down by Member States.
This Directive shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.
Annex I is amended as follows:
The competent authorities may allow the capital requirement for an exchange-traded future to be equal to the margin required by the exchange if they are fully satisfied that it provides an accurate measure of the risk associated with the future and that it is at least equal to the capital requirement for a future that would result from a calculation made using the method set out in the remainder of this Annex or applying the internal models method described in Annex VIII.
In paragraph 5, the third subparagraph is replaced by the following:
The competent authorities may allow the requirement against a written exchange-traded option to be equal to the margin required by the exchange if they are fully satisfied that it provides an accurate measure of the risk associated with the option and that it is at least equal to the capital requirement against an option that would result from a calculation made using the method set out in the remainder of this Annex or applying the internal models method described in Annex VIII.
In addition they may allow the requirement on a bought exchange-traded or OTC option to be the  same as that for the instrument underlying it, subject to the constraint that the resulting requirement does not exceed the market value of the option.
Paragraph 6 is replaced by the following:
Paragraph 33(i) is replaced by the following:
Annex II is amended as follows:
This is the difference between the agreed settlement price for the debt instrument, equity or commodity in question and its current market value, where the difference could involve a loss for the institution.
Paragraphs 3.1 and. are replaced by the following:
has paid for securities or commodities before receiving them or it has delivered securities or commodities before receiving payment for them;
The capital requirement shall be 8 % of the value of the securities or commodities or cash  owed to the institution multiplied by the risk weighting applicable to the relevant counterparty.
Repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements, securities or commodities lending and borrowing
In the case of reverse repurchase agreements and securities or commodities borrowing, the institution shall calculate the difference between the amount the institution has lent or the market value of the collateral and the market value of the securities or commodities it has received, where that difference is positive.
If the sum of an institutions overall net foreign-exchange position and its net gold position, calculated in accordance with the procedure set out below, exceeds 2 % of its total own funds,    it shall multiply the sum of its net foreign-exchange position and its net gold position by 8 % in order to calculate its own-funds requirement against foreign-exchange risk.
Paragraphs 3.1 and 3.2 are replaced by the following:
This position shall consist of the sum of the following elements (positive or negative):
the net forward position (i. e. all amounts to be received less all amounts to be paid under forward exchange and gold transactions, including currency and gold futures and the principal on currency swaps not included in the spot position),
net future income/expenses not yet accrued but already fully hedged (at the discretion of the reporting institution and with the prior consent of the competent authorities, net future income/expenses not yet entered in accounting records but already fully hedged by forward foreign-exchange transactions may be included here).
the net delta (or delta-based) equivalent of the total book of foreign-currency and gold options,
any positions which an institution has deliberately taken in order to hedge against the adverse effect of the exchange rate on its capital ratio may be excluded from the calculation of net open currency positions.
The same treatment subject to the same conditions as above may be applied to positions which an institution has which relate to items that are already deducted in the calculation of own funds.
Paragraph 4, first sentence, is replaced by the following:
Secondly, until 31 December 2004, the competent authorities may allow institutions to apply  an alternative method to those outlined in paragraphs 1 to 6 for the purposes of this Annex.
The alternative method described in the first subparagraph may only be used under the following conditions:
the competent authorities review the correlation coefficients regularly in the light of developments in foreign-exchange markets.
Paragraph 2, first sentence, is replaced by the following:
Paragraph 4 is replaced by the following:
Paragraphs 6 and 7 are replaced by the following:
The competent authorities may permit the ceiling for subordinated loan capital prescribed in paragraph 4 to be exceeded by a credit institution if they judge it prudentially adequate and provided that the total of such subordinated loan capital and the items referred to in paragraph 5 does not exceed 250 % of the original own funds left to meet the requirements imposed in Annexes I, II, III, VI, VII and VIII.
Each position in commodities or commodity derivatives shall be expressed in terms of the standard unit of measurement.
Positions in gold or gold derivatives shall be considered as being subject to foreign-exchange risk and treated according to Annex III or Annex VIII, as appropriate, for the purpose of calculating market risk.
The interest-rate and foreign-exchange risks not covered by other provisions of this Annex shall be included in the calculation of general risk for traded debt instruments and in the calculation of foreign-exchange risk.
For the purpose of paragraph 19, the excess of an institutions long (short) positions over its short (long) positions in the same commodity and identical commodity futures, options and warrants shall be its net position in each commodity.
The competent authorities may regard the following positions as positions in the same commodity:
positions in similar commodities if they are close substitutes and if a minimum correlation of 0,9 between price movements can be clearly established over a minimum period of one year.
The competent authorities may allow the capital requirement for an exchange-traded future to be equal to the margin required by the exchange if they are fully satisfied that it provides an accurate measure of the risk associated with the future and that it is at least equal to the capital requirement for a future that would result from a calculation made using the method set out in the remainder of this Annex or applying the internal models method described in Annex VIII.
Commodity swaps where one side of the transaction is a fixed price and the other the current market price shall be incorporated into the maturity ladder approach as a series of positions equal to the notional amount of the contract, with one position corresponding with each payment on the swap and slotted into the maturity ladder set out in the table appearing in paragraph 13.
Commodity swaps where the sides of the transaction are in different commodities are to be reported in the relevant reporting ladder for the maturity ladder approach.
The latter positions may be netted off against any offsetting positions in the identical underlying commodity or commodity derivative.
However, the competent authorities may also prescribe that institutions calculate their deltas using a methodology specified by the competent authorities.
The competent authorities may allow the requirement for a written exchange-traded commodity option to be equal to the margin required by the exchange if they are fully satisfied that it provides an accurate measure of the risk associated with the option and that it is at least equal to the capital requirement against an option that would result from a calculation made using the method set out in the remainder of this Annex or applying the internal models method described in Annex VIII.
In addition they may allow the requirement on a bought exchange-traded or OTC commodity option to be the same as that for the commodity underlying  it, subject to the constraint that the resulting requirement does not exceed the market value of the option.
Warrants relating to commodities shall be treated in the same way as commodity options under paragraph 10.
The institution shall use a separate maturity ladder in line with the following table for each commodity.
Physical stocks shall be assigned to the first maturity band.
positions in contracts maturing on the same date,
The institution shall then work out the sum of the long positions and the sum of the short positions in each maturity band.
That part of the unmatched long (short) position for a given maturity band that is matched by the unmatched short (long) position for a maturity band further out shall be the matched position between two maturity bands.
The institutions capital requirement for each commodity shall be calculated on the basis of the relevant maturity ladder as the sum of the following:
the matched position between two maturity bands for each maturity band into which an unmatched position is carried forward, multiplied by 0,6 % (carry rate) and by the spot price for the commodity;
The institutions overall capital requirement for commodities risk shall be calculated as the sum of the capital requirements calculated for each commodity according to paragraph 17.
% of the net position, long or short, multiplied by the spot price for the commodity;
The institutions overall capital requirement for commodities risk shall be calculated as the sum of the capital requirements calculated for each commodity according to paragraph 19.
Explicit recognition by the competent authorities of the use of models for supervisory capital purposes shall be required in each case.
the internal risk-measurement model is closely integrated into the daily risk-management process of the institution and serves as the basis for reporting risk exposures to senior management of the institution;
The unit must be responsible for designing and implementing the institutions risk-management system.
the institutions board of directors and senior management are actively involved in the risk-control process and the daily reports produced by the risk-control unit are reviewed by a level of management with sufficient authority to enforce both reductions of positions taken by individual traders as well as in the institutions overall risk exposure;
the institution has established procedures for monitoring and ensuring compliance with a documented set of internal policies and controls concerning the overall operation of the risk-measurement system;
the institution frequently conduct a rigorous programme of stress testing and the results of these tests are reviewed by senior management and reflected in the policies and limits it  sets;
This review must include both the activities of the business trading units and of the independent risk-control unit.
the adequacy of the documentation of the risk-management system and process and the organisation of the risk-control unit,
the process the institution employs for approving risk-pricing models and valuation systems that are used by front and back-office personnel,
the accuracy and completeness of position data, the accuracy and appropriateness of volatility and correlation assumptions, and the accuracy of valuation and risk sensitivity calculations,
the verification process the institution uses to evaluate back-testing that is conducted to assess the models accuracy.
The back-testing has to provide for each business day a comparison of the one-day value-at-risk measure generated by the institutions value by the end of the subsequent business day.
Back-testing on hypothetical changes in the portfolios value is based on a comparison between the portfolios end-of-day value and, assuming unchanged positions, its value at the end of the subsequent day.
For the purpose of calculating capital requirements for specific risk associated with traded debt and equity positions, the competent authorities may recognise the use of an institutions internal model if in addition to compliance with the conditions in the remainder of this Annex the model:
captures concentration in terms of magnitude and changes of composition of the portfolio,
validated through back-testing aimed at assessing whether specific risk is being accurately captured.
Institutions using internal models which are not recognised in accordance with paragraph 4 shall be subject to a separate capital charge for specific risk as calculated according to Annex I.
The multiplication factor shall be increased by a plus-factor of between 0 and 1 in accordance with the following table, depending on the number of overshootings for the most recent 250 business days as evidenced by the institutions back-testing.
An overshooting is a one-day change in the portfolios value that exceeds the related one-day value-at-risk measure generated by the institutions model.
The competent authorities can, in individual cases and owing to an exceptional situation, waive the requirement to increase the multiplication factor by the plus-factor according to the above table, if the institution has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the competent authorities that such an increase is unjustified and that the model is basically sound.
In order to allow competent authorities to monitor the appropriateness of the plus-factor on an ongoing basis, institutions shall notify promptly, and in any case no later than within five working days, the competent authorities of overshootings that result form their back-testing programme and that would according to the above table imply an increase of a plus-factor.
the specific risk portion of the value-at-risk measure which should be isolated according to supervisory guidelines; or, at the institutions option,
Institutions using option (ii) are required to identify their sub-portfolio structure beforehand and should not change it without the consent of the competent authorities.
Each institution must meet a capital requirement expressed as the higher of:
an average of the daily value-at-risk measures on each of the preceding 60 business days, multiplied by the factor mentioned in paragraph 6, adjusted by the factor mentioned in paragraph 7.
at least daily calculation of value-at-risk;
a 10-day equivalent holding period;
The competent authorities shall require that the model captures accurately all the material price risks of options or option-like positions and that any other risks not captured by the model are covered adequately by own funds.
As a minimum, the following provisions shall be respected:
The institution shall model the yield curves using one of the generally accepted approaches.
The risk-measurement system must also capture the risk of less than perfectly correlated movements between different yield curves;
for equity risk, the risk-measurement system shall use a separate risk factor at least for each of the equity markets in which the institution holds significant positions;
The risk-measurement system must also capture the risk of less than perfectly correlated movements between similar, but not identical, commodities and the exposure to changes in forward prices arising from maturity mismatches.
The competent authorities may allow institutions to use empirical correlations within risk categories and across risk categories if they are satisfied that the institutions system for measuring correlations is sound and implemented with integrity.
Having regard to Council Directive 88/320/EEC of 9 June 1988 on the inspection and verification of good laboratory practice (GLP) (1) as amended by Commission Directive 90/18/EEC (2), and in particular Article 7(2) thereof,
it is necessary to adapt for a second time the Annex to Directive 88/320/EEC so as to take account of the OECD Council Decision of 9 March 1995, and, by publishing the full text of the annexes on the inspection and verification of good laboratory practice, to facilitate the uniform interpretation thereof;
The Annex to Directive 88/320/EEC is replaced by the Annex hereto.
When Member States adopt these provisions, these shall contain a reference to this Directive or shall be accompanied by such reference at the time of their offi- cial publication.
The provisions for the inspection and verification of GLP which are contained in parts A and B are those contained in Annexes I (Guides for compliance monitoring procedures for good laboratory practice) and II (Guidance for the conduct of test facility inspections and study audits) respectively of the OECD Council Decision-Recommendation on compliance with principles of good laboratory practice [C(89)87(Final)] of 2 October 1989 as revised by the OECD Council Decision amending the Annexes to the Council Decision-Recommendation on compliance with principles of good laboratory practice of 9 March 1995 [C(95)8(Final)].
To facilitate the mutual acceptance of test data generated for submission to Regulatory Authorities of the  OECD member countries, harmonisation of the procedures adopted to monitor good laboratory practice compliance, as well as comparability of their quality and rigour, are essential.
It is recognised that Member States will adopt GLP principles and establish compliance monitoring proced- ures according to national legal and administrative practices, and according to priorities they give to, for example the scope of initial and subsequent coverage concerning categories of chemicals and types of testing.
The guidance set forth in the following paragraphs concerns each of these Authorities and compliance programmes, as appropriate.
In addition, the following definitions apply:
GLP compliance monitoring: the periodic inspection of test facilities and/or auditing of studies for the purpose of verifying adherence to GLP principles,
GLP Monitoring Authority: a body established within a Member State with responsibility for monitoring the good laboratory practice compliance of test facilities within its territories and for discharging other such functions related to good laboratory practice as may be nationally determined.
Test facility inspection: an on-site examination of the test facilitys procedures and practices to assess the degree of compliance with GLP principles.
Study audit: a comparison of raw data and associated records with the interim or final report in order to determine whether the raw data have been accurately reported, to determine whether testing was carried out in accordance with the study plan and standard operating procedures, to obtain additional information not provided in the report, and to establish whether practices were employed in the development of data that would impair their validity,
GLP compliance status: the level of adherence of a test facility to the GLP principles as assessed by the (national) GLP Monitoring Authority,
Components of good laboratory practice compliance monitoring procedures
ensure that the (national) GLP Monitoring Authority is directly responsible for an adequate âteam' of inspectors having the necessary technical/scientific expertise or is ultimately responsible for such a team,
publish documents providing details of the (national) GLP compliance programme, including information  on the legal or administrative framework within which the programme operates and references to published acts, normative documents (e.g., regulations, codes of practice), inspection manuals, guidance notes, periodicity of inspections and/or criteria for inspection schedules, etc.,
GLP Monitoring Authorities will have access to commercially valuable information and, on occasion, may even need to remove commercially sensitive documents from a test facility or refer to them in detail in their reports.
ensure that, unless all commercially sensitive and confidential information has been excised, reports of test facility inspections and study audits are made available only to Regulatory Authorities and, where appropriate, to the test facilities inspected or concerned with study audits and/or to study sponsors.
The number of inspectors required will depend on:
the frequency with which the GLP compliance status of the test facilities is to be assessed;
the number of special inspections or audits requested by Regulatory Authorities,
Inspectors should have qualifications and practical experience in the range of scientific disciplines relevant to the testing of chemicals.
encourage consultations, including joint training activities where necessary, with the staff of (national) GLP Monitoring Authorities in other OECD member countries in order to promote international harmonisation in the interpretation and application of GLP principles, and in the monitoring of compliance with such principles,
provide inspectors with a suitable means of identification (e.g., an identity card).
on the permanent staff of a body separate from the (national) GLP Monitoring Authority,
In the latter two cases, the (national) GLP Monitoring Authority should have ultimate responsibility for determining the GLP compliance status of test facilities and the quality/acceptability of a study audit, and for taking any action based on the results of test facility inspections or study audits which may be necessary.
As indicated above, Member States should publish the details of their (national) GLP compliance programmes.
define the scope and extent of the programme.
The scope of the monitoring for compliance should be defined, both with respect to the categories of chemicals and to the types of tests subject to it, for example, physical, chemical, toxicological and/or ecotoxicological,
The application of GLP principles to health and environmental safety data generated for regulatory purposes may be mandatory.
provide information on categories of test facility inspections/study audits.

provisions for special test facility inspections/study audits at the request of a Regulatory Authority, for example, prompted by a query arising from the submission of data to a Regulatory Authority,
While inspectors will not normally wish to enter test facilities against the will of the facilitys management, circumstances may arise where test facility entry and access to data are essential to protect public health or the environment.
describe the test facility inspection and study audit procedures for verification of GLP compliance.
Guidance for such procedures is available in part B of this Annex,
Follow-up to test facility inspections and study audits
Member States should take action where deviations from GLP principles are found during or after a test facility inspection or study audit.
If a test facility inspection or study audit reveals only minor deviations from GLP principles, the facility   should be required to correct such minor deviations.
Where no, or where only minor deviations have been found, the (national) GLP Monitoring Authority may:
The date of the inspections and, if appropriate, the categories of test inspected in the test facility at that time should be included.
provide the Regulatory Authority which requested a study audit with a detailed report of the findings.
Actions which may be taken include, but are not limited to, the following:
issuance of a recommendation to a Regulatory Authority that a study be rejected,
requiring that a statement detailing the deviations be attached to specific study reports,
However, it may not always be possible  for agreement to be reached.
REVISED GUIDANCE FOR THE CONDUCT OF TEST FACILITY INSPECTIONS AND STUDY AUDITS
It is principally concerned with test facility inspections, an activity which occupies much of the time of GLP inspectors.
General guidance for the conduct of study audits will be found at the end of this Annex.
Test facility inspections should be conducted on a regular, routine basis to establish and maintain records of the GLP compliance status of test facilities.
The definitions of terms in the OECD principles of good laboratory practice adopted in Article 1 of Directive 87/18/EEC and in part A of the Annex to this Directive are applicable to this part of the Annex.
Inspectors may be required to audit data relating to the physical, chemical, toxicological or ecotoxicological properties of a substance or preparation.
The wide diversity of facilities (in terms both of physical layout and management structure), together with the variety of types of studies encountered by inspectors, means that the inspectors must use their own judgment   to assess the degree and extent of compliance with GLP principles.
In the following sections, guidance is provided on the various aspects of the testing facility, including its personnel and procedures, which are likely to be examined by inspectors.
These lists are not meant to be comprehensive and should not be taken as such.
These aspects are the responsibility of those Regulatory Authorities to which the data are submitted for regulatory purposes.
Inspectors should therefore carry out their work in a carefully planned way and, so far as practicable, respect the wishes of the management of the test facility as to the timing of visits to certain sections of the facility.
It is essential that they ensure that such information is seen by authorised personnel only.
Purpose: to familiarise the inspector with the facility which is about to be inspected in respect of management structure, physical layout of buildings and range of studies.
Any existing information on the facility should be reviewed. This may include previous inspection reports, the layout of the facility, organisation charts, study reports, protocols and curricula vitae (CVs) of personnel.
the type, size and layout of the facility,
the management structure of the facility.
Where no previous test facility inspections have been conducted, a pre-inspection visit can be made to obtain relevant information.
This could allow the test facility to ensure that the appropriate personnel and documentation are available.
Purpose: to inform the management and staff of the facility of the reason for the test facility inspection or study audit that is about to take place, and to identify the facility areas, study(ies) selected for audit, documents and personnel likely to be involved.
At the starting conference, inspectors should:
describe the documentation which will be required for the test facility inspection, such as lists of on-going and completed studies, study plans, standard operating procedures, study reports, etc.
clarify or request information as to the management structure (organisation) and personnel of the facility,
make an initial determination as to the parts of the facility to be covered during the inspection,
indicate that a closing conference will be held at the completion of the inspection.
As a general rule, when inspecting a facility, inspectors will find it helpful to be accompanied by a member of the QA unit.
Purpose: to determine whether the test facility has sufficient qualified personnel, staff resources and support services for the variety and number of studies undertaken; the organisational structure is appropriate, and management has established a policy regarding training and staff health surveillance appropriate to the studies undertaken in the facility.
facility management and scientific organisation charts,
list(s) of on-going and completed studies with information on the type of study, initiation/completion dates, test system, method of application of test substance and name of study director,
an index to the facilitys standard operating procedures,
list(s) of the study directors and sponsors associated with the study(ies) being audited.
lists of on-going and completed studies to ascertain the level of work being undertaken by the test facility,
existence of SOPs for all relevant areas of testing.
The head of the quality assurance (QA) unit should be asked to demonstrate the systems and methods for QA inspection and monitoring of studies, and the system for recording observations made during QA monitoring.
that the QA unit functions independently from the staff involved in the studies,
that where studies are of such short duration that monitoring of each study is impracticable, arrangements exist for monitoring on a sample basis,
the extent and depth of QA monitoring of routine test facility operation,
that management receives reports from QA concerning problems likely to affect the quality or integrity of a study,
the QA role, if any, if studies or parts of studies are done in contract laboratories,
Purpose: to determine if the test facility, whether indoor or outdoor, is of suitable size, design and location to meet the demands of the studies being undertaken.
the design enables an adequate degree of separation so that, for example, test substances, animals, diets, pathological specimens, etc. of one study cannot be confused with those of another,
the general housekeeping is adequate for the various facilities and that there are, if necessary, pest control procedures.
Purpose: to determine whether the test facility, if engaged in studies using animals or other biological test systems, has support facilities and conditions for their care, housing and containment, adequate to prevent stress and other problems which could affect the test system and hence the quality of data.
The type of test systems being used will determine the aspects relating to care, housing or containment that the inspector will monitor.
there are facilities adequate for the test systems used and for testing needs,
there are arrangements to isolate animals (or other elements of a test system, if necessary) known to be, or suspected of being, diseased or carriers of disease,
the equipment for maintaining the environmental conditions required for each test system is adequate, well maintained, and effective,
analyses to check environmental conditions and support systems are carried out as required,
storage areas are provided for animal feed or equivalent materials for all test systems; that these areas are not used for the storage of other materials such as test substances, pest control chemicals or disinfectants, and that they are separate from areas in which animals are housed or other biological test systems are kept,
Apparatus, materials, reagents and specimens
apparatus is clean and in good working order,
materials and chemical reagents are properly labelled and stored at appropriate temperatures and that expiry dates are not being ignored.
specimens are well identified by test system, study, nature and date of collection,
Purpose: to determine whether adequate procedures exist for the handling and control of the variety of test systems required by the studies undertaken in the facility, for example, chemical and physical systems, cellular and microbic systems, plants or animals.
automated systems, data generated as graphs, recorder traces or computer print-outs are documented as raw data and archived.
test systems are as specified in study plans,
housing or containers of test systems are properly identified with all the necessary information,
there is an adequate separation of animal species (and other biological test systems) either in space or in time,
the recording of the receipt, handling, housing or containment, care and health evaluation is appropriate to the test systems,
there are provisions for the appropriate disposal of test systems at the end of tests.
there are written records on the receipt (including identification of the person responsible), and for the handling, sampling, usage and storage of tests and reference substances,
storage conditions are appropriate to preserve the concentration, purity and stability of the test and reference substances,
there are procedures for the determination of the homogeneity and stability of mixtures containing test   and reference substances, where applicable,
when the test is of longer than four weeks duration, samples from each batch of test and reference substances have been taken for analytical purposes and that they have been retained for an appropriate  time,
Purpose: to determine whether the test facility has written SOPs relating to all the important aspects of its operations, considering that one of the most important management techniques for controlling facility operations is the use of written SOPs.
procedures exist for revision and updating of SOPs,
historical files of SOPs are maintained,
receipt; determination of identity, purity, composition and stability; labelling; handling; sampling; usage; and storage of test and reference substances;
preparation of reagents and dosing formulations;
preparation and environmental control of areas containing the test systems;
handling of the test systems before, during and at the termination of the study;
Purpose: to verify that written study plans exist and that the plans and the conduct of the study are in accordance with GLP principles.
any amendments to the study plan were signed and dated by the study director,
measurements, observations and examinations were in accordance with the study plan and relevant SOPs,
any changes in the raw data, including data stored in computers, did not obscure previous entries, included the reason for the change and identified the person responsible for the change and the date it was made,
the computerised systems used within the study are reliable, accurate and have been validated,
the results presented in the reports of the study (interim or final) are consistent and complete and that they correctly reflect the raw data.
When examining a final report, the inspector should check:
signed and dated by other principal scientists, if reports from cooperating disciplines are included,
any amendments were made by the responsible personnel,
Storage and retention of records
that a person has been identified as responsible for the archive,
the procedures for retrieval of archived materials,
that an inventory is maintained of materials removed from, and returned to, the archives,
Test facility inspections will generally include, inter alia, study audits, which review on-going or completed studies.
Because of the wide variation in the types of studies which might be audited, only general guidance is appropriate, and inspectors and others taking part in study audits will always need to exercise judgment as to the nature and extent of their examinations.
In some cases, inspectors may need assistance from other experts in order to conduct an effective study audit, for example, where there is a need to examine tissue sections under the microscope.
obtain names, job descriptions and summaries of training and experience for selected personnel engaged   in the study(ies) such as the study director and principal scientists,
identify individual items of apparatus or special equipment used in the study and examine the calibration, maintenance and service records for the equipment,
attempt to determine, through the interview process if possible, the work assignments of selected individuals participating in the study to ascertain if these individuals had the time to accomplish the tasks specified in the study plan or report,
SOPs in use at the time the study was done;
In studies in which animals (i.e., rodents and other mammals) are used, the inspectors should follow a certain percentage of individual animals from their arrival at the test facility to autopsy.
animal body weight, food/water intake, dose formulation and administration, etc.,
Completion of inspection or study audit
test facility inspection of any large facility is likely to reveal a number of minor deviations from GLP principles but, normally, these will not be sufficiently serious to affect the validity of studies emanating from that test facility.
Nevertheless, details of the inadequacies or faults detected should be provided to the test facility   and assurances sought from its senior management that action will be taken to remedy them.
If a serious deviation from the GLP principles is identified during a test facility inspection or study audit  which, in the opinion of the inspector, may have affected the validity of that study, or of other studies performed at the facility, the inspector should report back to the (national) GLP Monitoring Authority.
Where a study audit has been conducted at the request of a Regulatory Authority, a full report of the findings should be prepared and sent via the relevant (national) GLP Monitoring Authority.
Having regard to Council Directive 70/156/EEC of 6 February 1970 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the type-approval of motor vehicles and their trailers (1), as last amended by Directive 98/91/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (2), and in particular Article 13(2) thereof,
Directive 77/540/EEC is one of the separate Directives of the EC type-approval procedure which has been established by Directive 70/156/EEC; whereas, consequently, the provisions laid down in Directive 70/156/EEC relating to vehicle systems, components and separate technical units apply to Directive 77/540/EEC;
the procedures should be simplified in order to maintain the equivalence envisaged by Article 9(2) of Directive 70/156/EEC between certain separate Directives and the corresponding regulations of the United Nations' Economic Commission for Europe (UN-ECE), when those regulations are amended; whereas, as a first step, the technical requirements of Directive 77/540/EEC should be replaced by those of UN-ECE Regulation No 77 by way of cross-reference;
the measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee for Adaptation to Technical Progress established by Directive 70/156/EEC,
Each Member State shall grant EC component type-approval for any type of parking lamp which satisfies the construction and testing requirements laid down in the relevant Annexes.
Member States shall, for each type of parking lamp which they approve pursuant to Article 1, issue to the manufacturer an EC component type-approval mark conforming to the model shown in Annex I, Appendix 3.
For the purposes of this Directive, "vehicle" means any motor vehicle intended for use on the road, with or without bodywork, having at least four wheels and a maximum design speed exceeding 25 km/h, and its trailers, with the exception of vehicles which run on rails and of agricultural and forestry tractors and all mobile machinery.
From 1 October 1999, or, if the publication of the texts referred to in Article 3 is delayed beyond 1 April 1999, six months after the actual date of publication of these texts, Member States may not, on grounds relating to parking lamps:
prohibit the registration, sale or entry into service of vehicles, or the sale or entry into service of parking lamps,

for any type of vehicle on grounds relating to parking lamps, and for any type of parking lamp, if the requirements of Directive 77/540/EEC, as amended by this Directive, are not fulfilled.
Notwithstanding paragraphs 2 and 3, for the purposes of replacement parts Member States shall continue to grant EC type-approval of parking lamps, and to permit their sale and entry into service,  in accordance with previous versions of Directive 77/540/EEC provided that such parking lamps
comply with the requirements of that Directive which were applicable when the vehicles where first registered.
Member States shall bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive by 1 October 1999; however, if the publication of the texts referred to in Article 3 is delayed beyond 1 April 1999, the Member States shall comply with this obligation six months after the actual date of publication of these texts.
When Member States adopt those provisions, they shall contain a reference to this Directive or be accompanied by such a reference on the occasion of their official publication.
Member States shall communicate to the Commission the texts of the main provisions of national law which they adopt in the field covered by this Directive.
ANNEX I: Administrative provisions for type approval
ADMINISTRATIVE PROVISIONS FOR TYPE APPROVAL

the Regulation in its original form (00) (1),
Where reference is made to "Regulation No 37", this shall be understood as "Annex VII to Directive 76/761/EEC."
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 95,
It is desirable to introduce into Council Directive 74/ 60/EEC (4), requirements concerning power-operated windows with the aim of eliminating the danger to children, which can occur when closing these windows; similar requirements should also apply to power-operated roof panel systems and partition systems; for this purpose the title and the scope of Directive 74/60/EEC should be amended accordingly.
In particular, Articles 3(4) and 4(3) of Directive 70/ 156/EEC require that each separate Directive has attached to it an information document incorporating the relevant items of Annex I to Directive 70/156/EEC and also a type-approval certificate based on Annex VI to Directive 70/156/EEC in order that type-approval may be computerised.
The amendments to Directive 74/60/EEC relate only to its administrative provisions and to power-operated windows, roof panel and/or partition systems; it is not necessary therefore to invalidate existing approvals granted under Directive 74/60/EEC nor to prevent the registration, sale and entry into service of new vehicles, which are not fitted with power-operated windows, roof panel and/or partition systems and which are covered by such approvals.
The title shall be replaced by the following:
Articles 1, 2 and 3 shall be replaced by the following:
No Member State may refuse to grant EC type-approval or national type-approval of a vehicle on grounds relating to the interior fittings of the vehicles if these meet the requirements set out in the Annexes hereto.
The Annexes shall be amended in accordance with the Annex to this Directive.
refuse, in respect of a type of vehicle, to grant EC type-approval or national type-approval, or
the vehicles comply with the requirements of Directive 74/ 60/EEC.
shall consider certificates of conformity which accompany new vehicles in accordance with the provisions of Directive 70/156/EEC to be no longer valid for the purposes of Article 7(1) of that Directive, and
on grounds relating to the interior fittings of motor vehicles if the vehicles are fitted with power-operated windows, roof panel and/or partition systems and the requirements of Directive 74/60/EEC, are not complied with.
Member States shall bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive before 8 April 2001 and shall forthwith inform the Commission thereof.
Member States shall communicate to the Commission the texts of the main provisions of national law which they adopt in the field governed by this Directive.

The compilation of structural statistics on earnings shall be based on local units and enterprises as defined in Council Regulation (EEC) No 696/93 (1) and shall provide information for employees in enterprises of 10 and more employees classified by size and principal activity.
M, N and O activities are, however, optional for 2001/02.
The size of the enterprise to which the local unit belongs classified as one of the following: 10-49, 50-249, 250-499, 500-999, 1 000 or more employees. The economic activity of the local unit coded at NACE Rev. Division level.
Within the meaning of Directive 80/723/EEC (on the transparency of financial relations between Member States and public undertakings), âpublic undertaking means any undertaking over which the public authorities may exercise directly or indirectly a dominant influence by virtue of their ownership of it, their financial participation therein, or the rules which govern it.
In order to identify the actual controlling entity, it is necessary to analyse the complete ownership chain if necessary.
The existence of a collective pay agreements covering the majority of employees in the observation unit: Collective pay agreements can be:
an industry agreement, setting terms and conditions of employment for all or most workers and employees in an individual industry or economic sector,
an enterprise, or single employer agreement, covering only those workers with the same employer, regardless of size.
an agreement applying only to the workers in this local unit,
yes answer should be given when more than 50 % of the employees in the local unit are covered by any one of the abovementioned collective pay agreements.
The number of employees should be in line with the information contained in the business register maintained for statistical purposes.
The aim is only to establish which is the largest market (solely one response).
The group of enterprises should be considered at world level.
When the local units belong to an enterprise group, it is in general well known.
The entity controlling the group of enterprises is the legal unit exercising actual control in the sense of the System of National Accounts 1993, Chapter 4.30.
In many cases, this country is the same as the country of location of the local unit under review.
Employees are all persons who have a direct employment contract with the enterprise or local unit and receive remuneration, irrespective of the type of work performed, the number of hours worked (full or part-time) and the duration of the contract (fixed or indefinite).
Apprentices and trainees should be included.
outworkers that are remunerated on the basis of the product or service they deliver,
interim workers (employed by/through agencies.
persons wholly remunerated by way of fees, or commission,
unpaid owners, directors or managers (paid by way of profit share or by fee),
Age in entire years at the specified date of the representative month.
Apprentices and trainees with an employment contract are classified in the occupation for which they carry out their apprenticeship or training period.
(European system of national and regional accounts in the European Community (ESA-95): 11.13 (g).
Persons working in a managerial post will usually require a significant amount of knowledge and experience of the production process and/or service requirements and administration procedures associated with the efficient functioning of organisations and businesses.
This variable indicates whether an employee has some form of management function (= yes) or not (= no).
Typically such a person might have a job description of âforeman or âsupervision together with the name of the occupation.
Information is to be collected concerning the level of general, professional or higher education which the employee has received according to the following ISCED 97 groupings:
Programmes at level 1 are normally designed on a unit or projet basis to give children a sound basic education in reading, writing and mathematics along with an elementary understanding of other subjects such as history, geography, natural science, social science, art and music.
- LOWER SECONDARY EDUCATION OR SECOND STAGE OF BASIC EDUCATION
- UPPER SECONDARY EDUCATION (code 03, no distinction a, b or c possible)
- Upper secondary education - general (optional) (code 04) - Upper secondary education - technical (optional) (code 05)
This item captures programmes that straddle the boundary between upper-secondary and post-secondary education from an international point of view, even though they might clearly be considered as upper-secondary or post-secondary programmes in a national context.
They are often not significantly more advanced than programmes at ISCED 3 but they serve to broaden the knowdlege of participants who have already completed a programme at level 3.
In cases where there is no certification, successful completion must be associated with full attendance.
Compared to 5A these programmes are practically oriented/occupationally specific and are mainly designed for participants to acquire the practical skills and know-how needed for employment in a particular occupation or trade or class of occupations or trades, the successful completion of which usually provides the participants with a labour-market relevant qualification.
Entry to these programmes normally requires the successful completion of ISCED level 3A or 3B or a similar qualification at ISCED level 4A.
These programmes must have a cumulative duration of at least two years.
- SECOND STAGE OF TERTIARY EDUCATION (LEADING TO AN ADVANCED RESEARCH QUALIFICATION)
The programmes are therefore devoted to advanced study and original research and not based on coursework only.
Length of service is defined as the number of entire years worked with the person's current employer.
Short-duration leaves (less than one year, e.g. for materinity or paternity leave or sickness) should be included.
Whether full-time or share of part-time:
Other cases are considered as part-time employees.
The following information on type of employment contract is requested:
An indefinite duration contract of employment is a contract between the employee and the employer, for which the actual duration of the contract has not been agreed in advance.
Apprenticeship or training contracts are specific fixed-duration contracts drawn up between the employer and the apprentice/trainee.
Citizenship is defined as the legal nationality of each person, and a citizen is a person who is a legal national by birth or naturalisation, whether by declaration, option, marriage or other means.
a total or partial exemption of tax and social contributions of the employer,
Subsidies paid to the enterprise which cannot be attributed to a particular employee (being calculated on the basis of manpower levels) are not included.
Years of career breaks in the current enterprise (optional):
Long-term breaks should be of more than one year.
Short-term breaks (less than one year) should not be included even if they cumulate to more than one year.
The following elements are included:
payments for overtime, allowances for teamwork, night work, week-end work, commissions, etc.,
payments for periods of absence and work stoppage paid for entirely by the employer,
payment to employees saving scheme.
payments paid in this period but relating to other periods, such as arrears, advances, or pay for holiday or sickness absence outside this period,
payments for periods of absence paid by the employer at a reduced rate,
allowances for work clothes or tools,
The full rate should be taken into account and not just the premium element added to the normal hourly rate.
This relates to the gross earnings paid during the reference year.
Severance payments should be excluded.
It would be useful to ask for the annual earnings for all employees of the sample, even if they have not been present the whole year.
It refers to any irregular payments which did not occur during each pay period, such as holidays bonuses, 13th month, allowances for leave not taken, occasional commissions, profit-shares, etc.
This refers to any regular bonuses which did not occur during each pay period, such as holiday bonuses, 13th or 14th month, etc.
Annual premiums related to profit-sharing (optional):
The total amount of compulsory social contributions and taxes paid by the employer on behalf of the employee to government authorities during the representative month.
This refers to the amount of the employee social security contribution laid down by law or by collective agreements and withheld by the employer.
Paid hours cover normal and overtime hours, remunerated during the representative month.
Using this method, it is necessary to ensure that there is consistency between the âpaid hours and the hours to which the salary corresponds.
NB: Normal basic hours are the number of hours which this employee is expected to work in the representative month excluding main meal breaks, and excluding all overtime hours, even if some of these are worked regularly or contractually.
Number of overtime hours paid in the representative month:
Only those overtime hours corresponding to overtime pay registered in 3.1.1 should be included.
Annual days of holiday leave (excluding days of sick leave):
It relates to the anual total of all normal paid-leave days, including those granted to the employee by reason of age, performance of special duties, seniority and other similar reasons.
Since the days of holiday worked have been paid for, not to adjust the total days of holiday would be double counting.
Similarly, when employees are offered additional (paid) time off under working-time reduction agreements, these are added to annual holidays.
The following are not regarded as annual-leave days:
days granted for personal resaons and paid.
Actual entire days of sick leave taken by the employee
Actual entire days of sick leave taken by the employee and not paid by the employer.
Estimation of the value of all payments in kind given to the employee during the reference year.
The factor indicates the number of local units in the population that each local unit in the sample represents.
For each local unit, it will be based on the number of the employees sampled within the unit and the total number of employees in the local unit, combined with the grossing-up factor for the local unit.
The individual data concerning each local unit and each employee have to be provided.
A: records for the local units; B: records for the employees.
The records should contain a field per variable.
The order of the fields should correspond to the order of the variables.
True zeros should be registered as numerical zeros.
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (1), Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (2),
The evolution towards an information and knowledge society should influence the life of every citizen in the European Union by, inter alia, affording new means of gaining access to knowledge and new ways of acquiring knowledge.
Digital content plays a predominant role in this evolu- tion.
Content production has given rise to rapid job creation in recent years and continues to do so.
The structures and business environment of the content industries are changing fast.
There are numerous barriers to the full development of the European content industries and markets.
On 8 December 1999 the Commission adopted the eEurope initiative which was subsequently welcomed by Member States at the Helsinki European Council of 10 and 11 December 1999.
On 23 and 24 March 2000 the European Council in Lisbon specifically recognised the role of the content industries in creating added value by exploiting and networking European cultural diversity.
The interim evaluations of the INFO2000 programme established by Council Decision 96/339/EC (2) and the multilingual information society initiative (MLIS) estab- lished by Council Decision 96/664/EC (3) call for a vigorous follow-up of the actions in the area of digital content and linguistic and cultural diversity.
The different rates of development on the provision and use of information services as well as of new communication techniques and the related content in the present Member States and in the candidate countries deserve special consideration, having regard to the internal cohe- sion of the Community and the risks associated with a two-tier information society.
The Commission has published in January 1999 a Green Paper on public sector information in the information society, launching a European debate on this topic.
The use of public sector information should respect provisions set by Member States on property rights of digitised material.
Since the objectives of the proposed actions cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States due to the transnational character of the issues at stake and can, therefore, by reason of the European scope and effects of the actions be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty.
Complementarity and synergy with related Community initiatives and programmes should be ensured by the Commission through appropriate coordination mechanisms.
In due course there should be an inde- pendent assessment of the progress of the programme so as to provide the background information needed in order to determine the objectives for subsequent content policy actions.
At the end of this programme, there should be a final assessment of the results obtained and a report to the European Parliament as to the future content policy and success/impact of this programme in achieving the objectives set out in this Decision.
A financial reference amount, within the meaning of point 34 of the Interinstitutional Agreement of 6 May 1999 between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission (5), is included in this Decision for the entire duration of the programme, without thereby affecting the powers of the budgetary authority as they are defined by the Treaty.
The programme has the following objectives:
stimulating access to and use of European digital content potential and especially promoting more effective use of information held by the public sector;
creating favourable conditions for the reduction of market fragmentation and for the marketing, distribution and use of European digital content on the global networks to stimulate economic activity and enhance employment prospects.
improving access to and expanding use of public sector information;
increasing dynamism of the digital content market.
The financial reference amount for the implementation of the programme for the period mentioned in paragraph 1 shall be EUR 100 million.
An indicative breakdown of expenditure is given in Annex II.
The Commission shall draw up a work programme every two years on the basis of this Decision.
The Commission shall act in accordance with the proce- dure referred to in Article 5(2) for the purposes of the following:
determination of the criteria and content of calls for the proposals, in line with the objectives outlined in Article 1;
any departure from the rules set out in Annex III;
Where the amount of the projects referred to in point 3(c) is less than EUR 700 000, the Commission shall merely inform the committee established by Article 5(1) of the projects and the outcome of their assessment.
The Commission shall inform the committee of progress with the implementation of the programme as a whole on at least a half yearly basis.
Where reference is made to this point, Articles 4 and 7 of Decision 1999/468/EC shall apply.
In order to ensure that Community aid is used efficiently, the Commission shall ensure that actions under this Decision are subject to effective prior appraisal, follow-up and subsequent evaluation.
The selected beneficiaries shall submit an annual report to the Commission.
The programme shall be open to participation of applicant countries on the following basis:
Participation may be opened, in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 5(2), without financial support by the Community from the programme, to legal entities estab- lished in third countries and to international organisations, where such participation contributes effectively to the imple- mentation of the programme and taking into account the principle of mutual benefit.
The action lines are a means to implement a European approach to the development of the digital content industries.
stimulating access to and use of European digital content potential, especially promoting more effective use of information held by the public sector,
creating favourable conditions for the reduction of market fragmentation and for the marketing, distribution and use of European digital content on the global networks to stimulate economic activity and enhance employment prospects, safeguarding cultural diversity, optimising the European heritage and facilitating access to knowledge.
Thus, linguistic aspects are essential for the cross-border exploitation of public sector information, facilitating access to capital for Internet start-ups is fundamental for the language industries, public sector information is an opportunity to be used by Internet firms in collaboration with public sector bodies, strategic views to be elaborated in close collaboration between the public and the private sectors will help identify emerging priority areas, etc.
high risk - high reward projects,
Application of existing technology (state of the art) will be required for the projects.
The Green Paper on public sector information in the information society, published in January 1999, triggered a discussion at European level on the issues of access to and exploitation of public sector information.
At the same time, experiments of public/private partnerships based on the principle of mutual benefit, started under the INFO2000 programme, should be accelerated and expanded.
The public sector collects and produces vast amounts of information, much of which is of interest to individuals and businesses, and which can be the raw material for value-added information services produced by the content industries.
These barriers lead to uncertainties, which in turn result into a lack of investment from both the public and the private sectors, degrading the level of services for users.
These projects, while safeguarding wide access to information in a multiplicity of languages on the global networks, will foster public-private partnerships, serving as catalysts to further developments in this field.
Given the huge potential of this domain, experiments with public-private partnerships, aimed at the exploitation of public sector information with a European interest, will continue.
Projects will address the main barriers hampering the development of a single market in public sector information, such as the possible need for common standards (for example in collecting methods), or the need for transparent pricing for public information access and use in the various Member States.
Application of different and emerging technologies (e.g. mobile applications) will be encouraged.
Establishment of European digital data collections
The absence of complete datasets at European level constitute indeed one of the barriers to the exploitation of the content potential.
This work will be conducted in accordance with Community law provisions regarding data protection.
Interest and commitment of public and private parties will be decisive for selecting the type of data and the areas to be covered, as well as the contribution of such projects to the achievement of public interest objectives, inter alia, in cultural, educational and social fields.
Adequate support for multilingual and cross-cultural information provision and access is a key enabler for the development of a European mass market for on-line products and services, and for a wider deployment of European content in other regions.
The programme will promote and support actions aimed at encouraging cooperation in the European content and language industries, thus helping to improve the competitive positions of both sectors.
Demonstration and infrastructure projects will be complemented by targeted accompanying actions aimed at documenting best practice, promoting exchanges and increasing awareness, and achieving cross-fertilisation of industrial, professional and national activities in the field.
The overall aim of this sub-line is to foster competitiveness and provide improved market opportunities for European content and language businesses, in particular innovative SMEs and start-ups, thus enhancing Europe's multilingual and multicultural presence on the global networks.
commercial content players (creators, designers, packagers and distributors) who intend to enhance their offerings (e.g. web portals, mobile services) and penetrate new markets,
Such actions are expected to encompass, for example:
projects connecting the knowledge in the areas of cultural creation, education, marketing and technology.
IT vendors and telecom operators will be encouraged to provide platforms and delivery channels enabling multilingual information access and delivery of content meeting the cultural requirements of the target communities.
It should be noted that the language issues are particularly relevant when taking into account expansion in geographical coverage of the programme in the central and eastern European countries.
It is the structural basis for any sustained internationalisation and localisation effort, especially for less widely spoken languages where market forces often provide insufficient incentives.
These resources must be pooled together to yield widely accessible repositories which can then be exploited by content providers and distributors, and by suppliers of language services.
language centres: networking of regional, national and subject/discipline specific data centres, coupled with user-friendly search aids, on-line referral and brokerage services, user advice and testing of language tools, framework agreements and technical standards enabling private and public sector stakeholders to share and reuse existing and upcoming resources,
new resources: creation and transnational distribution of new datasets for those languages and subject areas where no suitable resources exist and market forces have provided insufficient incentives to address the issue.
Specific actions geared towards the languages of major European Union trade partners may be undertaken where justified in terms of Community interest and export potential.
INCREASING THE DYNAMISM OF THE DIGITAL CONTENT MARKET
This has a negative impact on economic growth and employment.
Bridging the gap between digital content industries and capital markets
Corrective actions are needed to improve access to investment capital in order to bring out the full potential and improve business opportunities of European digital content industries in terms of valorisation of the European cultural heritage, business models, innovative applica- tions, mobile multimedia, etc.
In order to encourage the exchange of information and best practice, the focus of these actions will be on supporting the dissemination of expertise present in business universities and training centres and in the new economy in matters such as management and administrative skills, as well as deploying distance-learning facilities.
Rights trading between digital content market players
The effectiveness and efficiency of the multimedia rights clearance have a strong and direct impact on the functioning of the content industries.
Further support is needed to arrive at a unified European rights clearance approach.
Continuous interaction between market players and public parties will be of increasing importance as a key mechanism to foster the evolution of the vision-building process.
The focus of actions will be on defining and collecting relevant statistical data, on identifying and promoting European best practices and on developing and updating a continuous benchmarking with third countries.
Improving access to and expanding use of public sector information 40 % to 45 %
Increasing the dynamism of the digital content market 10 % to 15 %
The Commission will implement the programme in accordance with the technical content specified in Annex I.
The selection of shared-cost projects will normally be based on the calls for proposals procedure published in the Official Journal of the European Communities.
The main criterion for supporting projects through calls for proposals will be their potential contribution to achieving the objectives of the programme.
The Commission may also implement other more flexible funding schemes than the call for proposals in order to provide incentives for the creation of partnerships, in particular involving SMEs and organisations in less favoured regions, or for other exploratory activities in different segments of the multimedia content market.
The detailed arrangements for the procedures referred to under point 3 will be implemented after consultation of the committee referred to in Article 4 of this Decision, following the rules of Article 5 of this Decision, in accordance with the Financial Regulations. They will be published in the Official Journal of the European Communities.
Transparency will be achieved by publishing the work programme and circulating it to interested bodies.
This includes activities such as: studies and consultancy in support of the programme; preliminary actions in preparation of future activities; measures aimed at facilitating participation in the programme as well as facilitating access to the results produced under the programme; publications and activities for the dissemination, promotion and exploitation of results: brochures, electronic publications (CD-ROMs, DVD, web presence, etc.), participation at exhibitions, preparation of press-related material, etc.; analysis of possible socioeconomic consequences associated with the programme; and support activities such as spreading the use of digital content standards, and encouraging skills development at European level.
establishing a Programme relating to the Community framework strategy on gender equality
The principle of equal treatment for women and men is a fundamental principle of Community law and the Directives and other acts adopted in keeping with it have played a major part in improving the situation of women.
Experience has also shown that Community work in this area should be continued, combining integration of the gender dimension with specific action.
The persistence of structural, gender-based discrim- ination, double - and often multiple-discrimination faced by many women and persistent gender inequality justify the continuation and strengthening of Community action in the field and the adoption of new methods and approaches.
The Fourth World Conference on Women held in Beijing on 15 September 1995 adopted a Declaration and a Platform for Action calling on governments, the international community and civil society to take strategic action to eliminate both discrimination against women and the barriers to gender equality.
They also reaffirmed the need for its speedy and complete implementation.
The European Council, meeting in Lisbon on 23 and 24 March 2000 and at Santa Maria da Feira on 19 and 20 June 2000, called on the Commission and the Member States to further all aspects of equal opportunities in employment policies, for example by reducing occupa- tional segregation and making it easier to reconcile working and family life, in particular by setting a new benchmark for improved childcare provision.
In its Resolution of 29 June 2000 (6) the Council stressed the importance of a balanced participation by women and men in family and working life.
This Decision provides the structure for the horizontal and coordinating activities necessary to ensure coherence and to develop synergies with regard to the implementation of the Community framework strategy.
Measures to strengthen the capacity of key players involved in promoting gender equality should include the exchange of information, experience and best prac- tices among networks, including the network of Parliamentary Committees for Equal Opportunities for Women and Men in Member States and in the European Parliament and the Commission's experts' networks.
It is necessary for the success of any Community action for the results to be monitored and evaluated against the aims.
Furthermore this Programme should be opened up for participation by the applicant countries of Central and Eastern Europe, in accordance with the conditions established in the Europe Agreements, in their additional protocols and in the decisions of the respective Association Councils, to Cyprus, Malta and Turkey.
In the implementation of this programme, work carried out by other international organisations, in particular the United Nations, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, the International Labour Organisation and the Council of Europe, will be of particular interest.
Since the objectives of the proposed action by the Community, namely to promote gender equality, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States by reason of, inter alia, the need for multilateral partnerships, trans- national exchange of information and Community-wide dissemination of good practice, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty.
This Decision establishes, for the period from 1 January 2001 to 31 December 2005, a Community Action Programme, hereinafter referred to as the âProgramme.
The Programme is one of the instruments necessary for the implementation of the overall Community strategy on gender equality, which embraces all Community policies and action aimed at achieving gender equality, including gender mainstreaming policies and specific actions targeted at women.
These fields of intervention are: economic life, equal participation and representation, social rights, civil life, gender roles and stereotypes.
Within the framework of the principles referred to in Article 2 and taking into account, where appropriate, future legislative activity, the Programme shall have the following objectives:
to improve the understanding of issues related to gender equality, including direct and indirect gender discrimination and multiple discrimination against women, by evaluating the effectiveness of policies and practice through prior analysis, monitoring their implementation and assessing their effects;
With a view to achieving the objectives referred to in Article 3, the following Community actions will be imple- mented within a transnational framework:
analysis of factors and policies relating to gender equality, including the collection of statistics, studies, gender impact assessment, tools and mechanisms, development of indica- tors and benchmarks and effective dissemination of results.
transnational cooperation between parties through the promotion of networking and exchange of experiences at Community level.
Implementation of the Programme and cooperation with Member States
regularly exchange views with the Members of the Committee referred to in Article 7, with representatives of social partners at Community level and non-governmental organisations on the implementation and follow-up of the Programme and on related policy orientations.
The Commission shall inform the said Committee of these points of view;
The Commission, in cooperation with the Member States, shall take the necessary steps to:
ensure the dissemination of the results of the actions undertaken within the Programme;
The measures necessary for the implementation of this Decision relating to the matters referred to below shall be adopted in accordance with the management procedure referred to in Article 7(2):
the annual plan of work for the implementation of the programme's actions;
the annual budget and the distribution of funding between the various actions of the programme;
the criteria for monitoring and evaluating the programme, in particular its cost-effectiveness, and the arrangements for the dissemination of results.
Where reference is made to this paragraph, Articles 4 and 7 of Decision 1999/468/EC shall apply.
The Committee shall adopt its rules of procedure.
Where appropriate, the Commission shall establish regular and structured cooperation between this Committee and the monitoring committees established for other relevant policies, instruments and actions.
The Commission and the Member States shall ensure consistency and complementarity between action undertaken under this Programme and other relevant Union and Community actions, such as those supported by the DAPHNE, STOP, PHARE and MEDA programmes, the research frame- work programmes to combat social exclusion, the social agenda and the Community action programme to combat discrimination.
The Member States shall facilitate and make all possible efforts to ensure that activities under this Programme are consistent with and complementary to those carried out at national, regional and local levels.
The Programme shall be open to the participation of:
the applicant countries of Central and Eastern Europe (CEECs) in accordance with the conditions established in the Europe Agreements, in their additional protocols and in the decisions of the respective Association Councils;
The financial reference amount for the implementation of the Programme for the period shall be EUR 50 million.
The Programme shall be evaluated by the Commission at its mid-term and at the end of the Programme with the assis- tance of independent experts.
The evaluation will also examine the complementarity between action under the Programme and that pursued under other relevant Community policies, instruments and actions.
The Commission shall submit a final evaluation report on the Framework Strategy and the Programme to the European Parliament, the Council, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions by 31 December 2006 at the latest.
For the Council The President Ã. GUIGOU
This area relates to the remaining gender gaps in the labour market and the ways to tackle them.
The issues of gender segregation of the labour market, including vertical segregation (the glass ceiling) and the gender pay gap which are the main subject of the Community programmes referred to in Article 9(2) may fall within the Programme where this will ensure an integrated approach to the different areas covered by it or to types of action not financed by the said programmes.
The actions consist in adopting strategies and instruments to promote women political, economic and social decision-making at all levels, including activities in external relations and development cooperation (such as the role and participation of women in international missions).
This area covers the enforcement of the human rights of women.
This area covers the stereotyped images of women and men and the need to change behaviour, attitudes, norms and values to take account of the evolution of the roles of men and women in society.
Under the conditions and implementing arrangements set out in this Annex, access to the Programme is open to all public and/or private bodies and institutions involved in promoting gender equality, and notably to:
The organisation of conferences, seminars and events at European level;
The organisation of European media campaigns and events to support the transnational exchange of information and the identification and dissemination of good practice, including the award of an annual prize to companies successful in promoting gender equality and with a view to strengthen the visibility of gender issues;
The implementation of transnational initiatives such as meetings, seminars or campaigns, on particular topics approved annually, after discussion with the Committee referred to in Article 7.
Organisation of seminars and the dissemination of information on and in support of the implementation of Community law in the field of gender equality, with particular attention being paid to the needs and requirements of the applicant countries.
The development and dissemination of methodologies and indicators for evaluating the effectiveness of gender equality policies and practice (benchmarking);
The collection, evaluation and dissemination of recent information and experience regarding successful initiatives, methods and techniques relating to women and the media, including overcoming gender stereotypes and promoting positive and varied portrayals of women and men in the media;
The realisation and dissemination of thematic studies on the target areas comparing and contrasting approaches within and across Member States and applicant countries;
When implementing this strand the Commission will in particular ensure consistency and complementarity with the activities conducted by other Commission services or by European agencies; in particular, the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions and the Community RTD Framework programme and the European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training (Cedefop).
Transnational exchange actions involving a range of players from at least three Member States, consisting of the transfer of information, lessons learned and good practice.
These actions may include comparison of the effectiveness of processes, methods and tools related to the chosen themes, mutual transfer and application of good practice, exchanges of personnel, joint development of products, processes, strategy and methodology, adaptation to different contexts of methods, tools and processes identified as good practice, and/or dissemination of results, profile-raising materials and events.
Actions 5 and 6, to be implemented under the authority of the Member States or by equality bodies, may be subsidised in response to restricted calls for tenders addressed to the Member States.
Action 1 will be implemented following the relevant Eurostat procedures.
The actions may be implemented by NGOs or social partners at European level, transnational networks of regional or local authorities or by transnational networks of organisations, which aim to promote gender equality.
The actions to be taken may be funded by service contracts following calls for tender or by subsidies for joint financing with other sources.
When carrying out the Programme, the Commission may require additional resources, including recourse to experts.
When carrying out the Programme, the Commission may have recourse to technical and/or administrative assistance, to the mutual benefit of the Commission and of the beneficiaries, related to identification, preparation, management, monitoring, audit and control.
It may also undertake evaluation studies and organise seminars, colloquia or other meetings of experts.
Moreover, it will also specify the arrangements and criteria to be applied in selecting and financing actions under the Programme.
Actions undertaken will fully respect the principles of data protection.

The sampling plans and diagnostic methods for the detection and confirmation of certain fish diseases have been laid down in Commision Decision 92/532/EEC (3), as amended by Commission Decision 96/240/EC (4).
This requires the sampling plans and diagnostic methods to be updated.
The Community reference laboratory for fish diseases, established by Council Directive 93/53/EEC (5), has been consulted.
The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Veterinary Committee,
The present Decision shall repeal Decision 92/532/EEC.
provides for guidelines and minimum requirements on sampling plans and diagnostic methods for the detection and confirmation of the presence of viral haemorrhagic septicaemia (VHS) and infectious haematopoietic necrosis (IHN);
sets out provisions aiming at the proper diagnosis of VHS and IHN and at the official recognition of the status of zones and of farms in non-approved zones in accordance with Articles 5 and 6 of Directive 91/67/EEC;
Accordingly, emphasis is put on the sampling procedures, principles and applications of laboratory tests and evaluation of their results, as well as on detailed laboratory techniques.
Part I includes sampling plans and diagnostic methods for the surveillance of VHS and IHN in order to obtain and maintain approved status of a zone or a farm in a non-approved zone.
Acronyms and abbreviations are listed in Part V.
General provisions on clinical health inspections, collection and selection of samples for surveillance of zones or farms in non-approved zones in order to achieve or maintain approved status for VHS and/or IHN
Further details are laid down in Parts I.I.2 to I.I.4.
The clinical inspections must be carried out during the period October to June or whenever the water temperature is below 14 Â°C.
All production units (ponds, tanks, net-cages, etc.) must be inspected for the presence of dead, weak or abnormally behaving fish.
Fish to be sampled shall be selected as follows.
If rainbow trout are not present, the sample has to be obtained from fish of all other species present whenever these species are susceptible to VHSV and/or IHNV (as listed in Annex A to Directive 91/67/EEC).
If more than one water source is utilised for fish production, fish representing all water sources must be included for sampling.
If such fish are not present, the fish selected must include normally appearing, healthy fish collected in such a way that all parts of the farm as well as all year classes are proportionally represented in the sample.
A zone or a farm in a non-approved zone that is placed under the supervision of the official services can obtain an approved status for VHS and/or IHN subject to either:
Following at least two years of absence of any clinical or other sign of VHS and/or IHN, all farms in the zone or any farm in a non-approved zone which are to be approved must be health-inspected twice per year for two years.
Further, the samples must be selected, prepared and examined as described in Parts I.I to I.IV and the laboratory examinations must have produced negative results for VHS and/or IHN; or
Following an official health inspection programme documenting the historical freedom from VHS and/or IHN for at least four years, all farms in the zone or any farm in a non-approved zone which are to be approved must be health-inspected twice per year for two years.
Further, the samples must be selected, prepared and examined as described in Parts I.I to I.IV and the laboratory examinations must have produced negative results for VHS and/or IHN.
Special provisions for approval of new farms and farms which recommence their activities with fish, eggs or gametes from an approved zone or an approved farm in a non-approved zone
Accordingly, the sampling provisions laid down in Models A and B above (Parts I.I.2.1.
In order to maintain approved status of a zone or a farm in a non-approved zone for VHS and/or IHN, inspections and sampling for examination must be carried out in accordance with Table 1C.
Preparation and shipment of samples from fish
The combination of 200 iu penicillin, 200 Âµg streptomycin, and 200 Âµg kanamycin per millilitre (ml) can be recommended, but other antibiotics of proven efficiency may be used as well.
In some cases, ovarian fluid must be examined (Tables 1A to C).
The tissue in each sample should weigh a minimum of 0,5 gram (g).
The temperature of a sample during transit should never exceed 10 Â°C and ice should still be present in the transport box at receipt or one or more freeze blocks must still be partly or completely frozen.
In exceptional (1) cases the virological examination may be started at the latest within 72 hours after the collection of the material, provided that the material to be examined is protected by transport medium and that the temperature requirements during transportation can be fulfilled (Part I.I.3, paragraph 3).
Whole fish may be wrapped up in paper with absorptive capacity and must finally be shipped in a plastic bag, chilled as mentioned.
All packaging and labelling must be performed in accordance with present national and international transport regulations as appropriate.
According to agreement with the involved diagnostic laboratory, other fish tissues may be collected as well and prepared for supplementary examinations.
Where practical difficulties arise (e.g. bad weather conditions, non-working days, laboratory problems, etc.) which make it impossible to inoculate cells within 48 hours after the collection of the tissue samples it is acceptable to freeze the tissue specimens in cell culture medium at â 20 Â°C or below and carry out virological examination within 14 days.
Records must be kept with details on the reason for each freezing of tissue samples (such as storm, cell lines died, etc.)
If a sample consisted of whole fish less than 4 cm long, these should be minced with sterile scissors or scalpel after removal of the body behind the gut opening.
If a sample consisted of whole fish more than 6 cm long, tissue specimens should be collected as described in Part I.I.3.
The final ratio between tissue material and transport medium must be adjusted in the laboratory to 1:10.
If shipment of the sample has been made in a transport medium (i.e. with exposure to antibiotics) the treatment of the supernatant with antibiotics may be omitted.
If the collected supernatant is stored at â80 Â°C within 48 hours after the sampling it may be reused only once for virological examination.
Where practical difficulties arise (e.g. incubator breakdown, problems with cell cultures, etc.) which make it impossible to inoculate cells within 48 hours after the collection of the tissue samples, it is acceptable to freeze the supernatant at
Prior to the inoculation of the cells the supernatant is mixed with equal parts of a suitably diluted pool of antisera to the indigenous serotypes of IPN virus and incubated with this for a minimum of one hour at 15 Â°C or a maximum of 18
When samples come from production units, which are considered free from IPN, treatment of inocula with antiserum to IPN virus may be omitted.
Cell cultures to be used for inoculation with tissue material should be young (4 to 48 hours old) and actively growing (not confluent) at inoculation.
At least two cell lines have to be inoculated (See Part I. III.1).
For each dilution and each cell line a minimum of about 2 cm2 cell area, corresponding to one well in a 24-well cell culture tray, has to be utilised.
At least every six months or if decreased cell susceptibility is suspected, titration of frozen stocks of VHSV and IHNV is performed to verify the susceptibility of the cell cultures to infection.
Inoculated cell cultures must be inspected regularly (at least three times a week) for the occurrence of CPE at 40 to 150  magnification.
If no CPE has developed after the primary incubation for 7 to 10 days, subcultivation is performed to fresh cell cultures utilising a cell area similar to that of the primary culture.
The pools are then inoculated into homologous cell cultures undiluted and diluted 1:10 (resulting in final dilutions of 1:10 and 1:100, respectively, of the supernatant) as described in Part I.III2.
The inoculation may be preceded by preincubation of the dilutions with the antiserum to IPN virus at appropriate dilution as described in Part I.II.3.
When toxic CPE develops after three days, the cells may be passed once and incubated to achieve the total of 14 days from the primary inoculation.
If bacterial contamination occurs despite treatment with antibiotics, subcultivation must be preceded by centrifugation at 2 000 to 4 000  g for 15 to 30 min at 2 to 5 Â°C, and/or filtration of the supernatant through a 0,45 Âµm filter (low protein-binding membrane).
If these tests have not allowed definitive identification of the virus within one week, the supernatant must be forwarded to a national reference laboratory or to the EU reference laboratory for fish diseases for immediate identification.
Aliquots of the two supernatant dilutions are mixed and incubated for 60 minutes at 15 Â°C with equal parts of the following reagents separately:
serum containing group specific antibody against IHNV at a 1:50 (vol:vol) dilution (1)
From each virus supernatant-serum mixture at least two cell cultures are inoculated with 50 Âµl each and then incubated at 15 Â°C.
Some VHSV strains do not react in neutralisation tests.
For each virus isolate to be identified, at least eight coverglasses or equivalent are seeded with cells at a density leading to about 60 % to 90 % confluence after 24 hours of cultivation.
When the cells have sedimented onto the glass surface (about one hour after seeding), or when the cultures have been incubated for up to 24 hours, the virus to be identified is inoculated.
After incubation, the cultures are rinsed twice in Eagle's MEM without serum, fixed in 80 % ice cold acetone and then stained by means of a two-layer IFAT.
The second reagent layer is a fluorochrome-conjugated antiserum to the immunoglobulin used in the first layer.
Proper negative and positive controls have to be included in the test.
Use 10  or 12  eyepieces and  25 or  40 objective lens with numerical apertures > 0,7 and > 1,3, respectively.
Other IF techniques (with regard to cell cultures, fixation and antibodies of reference quality) of proven efficiency may be used alternatively.
Wells in microtitre plates are coated overnight with recommended dilutions of purified immunoglobulin fractions of antibodies of reference quality.
Following rinsing with PBS-Tween-20 buffer, biotinylated antibodies of a specificity corresponding to that of the coating antibodies are added and allowed to react for 60 minutes at 20 Â°C.
After a last rinse, bound enzyme is visualised using appropriate ELISA substrates (OPD or others).
Other ELISA versions of proven efficiency may be used instead.
(in accordance with Directive 91/67/EEC, Annexes B and C and the provisions set out in Part I of this Annex)
Alternatively, a reduced sample size as listed in Table 1B may be used if requirements as described in the text Parts II.1, I.I.2.1. b and III are fulfilled.
The samples have to be collected no sooner than three weeks after transfer of fish from fresh to saltwater.
(in accordance with Directive 91/67/EEC, Annexes B and C and the provisions set out in Parts I and III of this Annex)
In approved zones samples only have to be collected by rotation in 50 % of the fish farms each year.
Diagnostic procedures for the confirmation of VHS and IHN in suspected outbreaks
conventional virus isolation with subsequent serological virus identification,
other diagnostic techniques (IFAT, ELISA).
Either method A or B must also be used.

after an officially recognised eradication programme for VHSV and/or IHNV including removal of all fish in the farm, cleaning, disinfection and fallowing before restocking with fish from approved farms, or
The health inspection programme must be based on both clinical inspections and laboratory examinations.
At least at one of the inspections carried out each year, 30 fish tissue and/or ovarian fluid samples shall be collected from each farm.
The health inspection programme shall be conducted for at least four years in all farms in the zone or in the farm (in a non-approved zone) to be approved.
Procedure for titration to verify the susceptibility of the cell cultures to infection
At least two VHSV isolates and one isolate of IHNV should be used.
Well-defined isolates from the Member States should be used.
Batches of virus in low cell culture passage numbers are propagated in cell culture flasks on BF-2 or RTG-2 cells for VHSV and on EPC or FHM cells for IHNV.
Use low MOI for inoculation (< 1).
One week after freezing, three replicate vials with each virus are thawed under cold water and titrated on their respective cell lines.
Titration procedures must be described in detail and the same procedure followed each time.
The titres are compared with previously obtained titres.
If different cell lines are kept in the laboratory each line should be examined separately.

implementing Council Regulation (EC) No 1165/98 concerning short-term statistics as regards the definition of variables
Regulation (EC) No 1165/98 established a common framework for the production of short-term Community statistics on the business cycle.
The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion delivered by the Statistical Programme Committee, established by Council Decision 89/382/EEC, Euratom (2),
Member States shall apply the definitions set forth in the Annex for the collection of statistical data covered by Regula- tion (EC) 1165/98 not later than one year after the present Regulation enters into force.
Member States shall, in the implementation of the definitions set forth in the Annex, take the necessary measures to assure that existing statistical data covered by Regulation (EC) 1165/ 98 will be revised by recalculation or estimation to satisfy these definitions.
Information on conformance to the definitions
DEFINITION OF OBJECTIVES AND CHARACTERISTICS OF VARIABLES
It provides a measure of the volume trend in value added at factor cost over a given reference period (1).
Value added at factor cost (2) can be calculated from turnover (excluding VAT and other similar deductible taxes directly linked to turnover), plus capitalised production, plus other operating income plus or minus the changes in stocks, minus the purchases of goods and services, minus other taxes on products which are linked to turnover but not deductible, minus the duties and taxes linked to production.
Value-added at factor cost is calculated âgross as value adjustments (such as depreciation) are not subtracted.
The first comprises VAT and other deductible taxes directly linked to turnover which are excluded from turnover.
The second group concerns all other taxes and duties linked to products which are either: (1) linked to turnover and not deductible, or (2) taxes on products not linked to turnover.
The third group concerns taxes and duties linked to production.
The common understanding of the term âproduction index as an âevolution of value added contradicts the definition of âproduction in the framework of national accounts or structural business statistics, but nonetheless is the correct term traditionally used in this area of business statistics.
As the index follows the evolution of production at constant prices, sometimes the term âproduction volume index is used.
National accounts have introduced the concept of âvalue added at basic prices.
The alignment with the national accounts may introduce some advantages, so Member States may use the concept of value added at basic prices as a proxy for value added at factor costs.
In practice, suitable proxy values for the continuation of the indices are:
continuation with raw material input,
variations in type and quality of the commodities and of the input materials,
changes in technical input-output relations (processing techniques),
The objectives and characteristics of indices for variable 110 (production) also apply to the indices for the variables on building construction and civil engineering.
These indices aim to show the evolution of value added for each of the two main sections in construction, namely buildings and civil engineering works.
Turnover (1) comprises the totals invoiced by the observation unit during the reference period, and this corresponds to market sales of goods or services supplied to third parties.
Reduction in prices, rebates and discounts as well as the value of returned packing must be deducted.
Income classified as other operating income, financial income and extraordinary income in company accounts is excluded from turnover.
According to this definition, the items generally included are:
sales of goods purchased for resale in the same condition as received,
The expressions âturnover, âsales, âdeliveries and âshipments are often used as synonyms in the context of short-term statistics.
invoiced mounting, installations and repairs,
sales of supplied electric power, gas, heat, steam and water,
Subject to the treatment of income classified as other operating income, financial income and extraordinary income in company accounts (1), the items generally excluded are:
receipts from staff facilities (for example from a factory canteen),
sales of own land and fixed assets,
The above items may be included if they generate turnover in the principle field of operation of the observation unit.
The indices of domestic and non-domestic turnover require turnover to be split according to the first destination of the product based on the change of ownership (whether or not there are also corresponding physical movements of goods across frontiers).
The domestic market is defined as third parties resident in the same national territory as the observation unit.
It can be calculated as turnover at current prices, deflated by the deflator of sales, or as a quantity index derived directly from the quantity of goods sold.
It is the objective of the new orders received index to show the development of demand for products and services as an indication of future production.
An order is defined as the value of the contract linking a producer and a third party in respect of the provision by the producer of goods and services.
New orders refer to goods and services to be provided by the observation unit, including those originating from sub-contractors.
VAT and other similar deductible taxes directly linked to turnover,
subsidies received from public authorities or the institutions of the European Union.
Orders of previous periods that have been cancelled during the observation period are not to be deducted from the new orders received nor is the index for previous periods revised due to cancellations.
The value of new orders also includes all other charges (transport, packaging, etc.) passed on to the customer, even if these charges will be listed separately in the invoice.
The objectives and characteristics of indices for variable 130 (new orders received) also apply to the indices for the distinction between domestic and non-domestic new orders.
The origin is determined by the residency of the third party that has made the order.
Variable 135: New orders for building construction Variable 136: New orders received for civil engineering
The division of new orders received between building construction and civil engineering is based on the classification of types of construction (CC).
It is the objective of the index of number of persons employed to show the development of employment in industry, construction and services.
It also includes part-time workers who are regarded as such under the laws of the country concerned and who are on the payroll, as well as seasonal workers, apprentices and home workers on the payroll.
Unpaid family workers refer to persons who live with the proprietor of the unit and work regularly for the unit, but do not have a contract of service and do not receive a fixed sum for the work they perform.
According to this definition, the groups included are:
persons on temporary leave (maternity, sickness leave, strike, lock-out, etc.) for a definite period,
persons on indefinite leave (e.g. long term sickness, military service or social service),
family workers included on the payroll of another unit as their principal occupation.
The number of employees is used as a temporary approximation of the number of persons employed.
The relationship of employer to employee exists when there is an agreement, which may be formal or informal, between an enterprise and a person, normally entered into voluntarily by both parties, whereby the person works for the enterprise in return for remuneration in cash or in kind.
A worker from a temporary employment agency is considered to be an employee of the temporary employment agency and not of the unit (customer) in which they work.
employees engaged under a contract specifically designed to encourage the recruitment of unemployed persons,
The number of employees includes part-time workers, seasonal workers, persons on strike or on short-term leave, but excludes persons on long-term leave.
The number of employees should be determined as a representative figure for the reference period.
The total number of hours worked by employees represents the aggregate number of hours actually worked for the output of the observation unit during the reference period.
It also excludes meal breaks and commuting between home and work.
The unpaid family workers have been added as a matter of principle although accurate figures may be difficult to obtain.
the total amount of all hours actually worked:
the time spent on tasks such as work preparation, preparing, maintaining and cleaning tools and machines and writing up work cards and reports,
short rest periods at the place of work, including tea and coffee breaks.
time spent for meal breaks,
Wages and salaries include the values of any social contributions, income taxes, etc. payable by the employee even if they are actually withheld by the employer and paid directly to social insurance schemes, tax authorities, etc. on behalf of the employee.
Wages and salaries include: all gratuities, bonuses, ex gratia payments, 13th month payments, severance payments, lodging, transport, cost-of living, and family allowances, tips, commission, attendance fees, etc. received by employees, as well as taxes, social security contributions and other amounts payable by employees and withheld at source by the employer.
all basic wages and salaries payable at regular intervals,
any allowances, gratuities or bonuses paid by the employer, such as:
allowances for travelling to and from work,
allowances actually paid for annual holidays not taken,
extra allowances for extreme working conditions like dust, dirt, temperature, smoke, danger, etc.,
allowances for improvement proposals and patent fees paid to the person employed,
value of bonus shares distributed free to the employees,
taxes, contributions and other sums payable by employees and deducted by employers,
statutory social contributions payable by the employer,
imputed social contributions (social benefits paid directly by the employer),
taxes paid by the employer on the total wages and salaries paid,
expenditure for vocational training (training costs), excluding apprentices wages and salaries,
other labour cost expenditure payable by the employer:
For the evaluation of payments in kind the following rule applies: payments in kind produced by the employer should be valued at producer prices; payments in kind bought by the employer should be valued at market prices.
The domestic output price index for an economic activity measures the average price development of all goods and related services resulting from that activity and sold on the domestic market.
When combined, these two indices show the average price development of all goods and related services resulting from an activity.
The specification must be such that in subsequent reference periods, the observation unit is able uniquely to identify the product and to provide the appropriate price per unit.
the appropriate price is the ex-factory (2) price that includes all duties and taxes on the goods on services invoiced by the unit but excludes VAT invoiced by the unit vis-a-vis its customer and similar deductible taxes directly linked to turnover,
order to show the true evolution of price movements, it should be an actual transaction price, and not a list price,
the price collected in period t should refer to orders booked during period t (moment of order), not the moment when the commodities leave the factory gates,
If no price information is available for the day in question, the price may represent an average over the whole period.
They measure the evolution of residential buildings excluding residences for communities, non-residential buildings, land prices and architect's and other fees.
They therefore do not only reflect the variations in the cost factors of construction, but also the changes in productivity and profit margins.
Stock options have been excluded mainly for practical reasons linked to the difficulties of a harmonised definition and data collec- tion although it is often considered as a compensation for work linked to the overall performance of the company.
Variable 311: Output prices of the domestic market Variable 312: Output prices of the non-domestic market
The indices of domestic and non-domestic prices require separate output price indices to be compiled according to the destination of the product.
The unit value index may be used as an approximation for non-domestic output prices.
This unit value is then treated as the average price of the product and the index calculated in the same way as for the traditional output price indices.
The component costs index (material costs and labour costs) shows the price developments of production factors used in the construction industry.
Costs that constitute components of the construction costs are also plant and equipment, transport, energy and other costs.
The material costs index is generally calculated using material prices.
Prices should be based on a sample of products and suppliers.
The labour cost index should cover wages and salaries and social security charges for all persons employed.
Variable 411: Building permits: number of dwellings
A building permit is an authorisation to start work on a building project.
An index based on these permits should provide a good indication of the workload for the building industry in the near future, although this may not be the case when a large proportion of permits are not used or when there is a long time lag between permits and building starts.
A dwelling is a room or suite of rooms and its accessories in a permanent building or structurally separated part thereof which by the way it has been built, rebuilt, converted and so on, is intended for private habitation.
Detached rooms for habitation which are clearly to be used as a part of the dwelling should be counted as part of the dwelling.
Variable 412: Building permits: square metres of useful floor area or alternative size measure
As such a permit is the final stage of planning and building authorisations from public authorities, prior to the start of work.
The useful floor area of a building (1) is measured within its external walls, excluding:
functional areas for ancillary use (e.g. areas occupied by heating and air-conditioning installations, or by power generators),
The part of the overall useful area of a building used for residential purposes includes the area used for kitchens, living rooms, bedrooms and ancillary rooms, cellars and common rooms used by the owners of the residential units.
Regulation (EC) No 1165/98 refers to the CC classification in requesting data about building permits for different categories of buildings.
wholesale and retail trade buildings,
It is the objective of the deflator of sales to adjust turnover for the impact of price changes.
The prices used to calculate the deflator for an activity are calculated as a weighted average of the relevant goods price indices for that activity.
The specification must be such that in subsequent reference periods, the observation unit is able uniquely to identify the good and to provide the appropriate price per unit.
The collected price information refers preferably to a specific date during the month.
The economic territory includes the following items:
any free zones, including bonded warehouses and factories under customs control,
territorial enclaves, i.e. geographic territories situated in the rest of the world and used, under international treaties or agreements between States, by general government agencies of the country (embassies, consulates, military bases, scientific bases, etc.),
The economic territory excludes the following items:
This definition follows the European System of Accounts (ESA) 1995, paragraphs 2.05-2.06.
This definition may be revised in the future in order to take specific account of European and/or monetary integration in line with other relevant regulations.
Having regard to Council Directive 85/591/EEC of 20 December 1985 concerning the introduction of Community methods of sampling and analysis for the monitoring of foodstuffs intended for human consumption (1), and in particular Article 1,
Council Directive 89/397/EEC of 14 June 1989 on the official control of foodstuffs (5) lays down the general principles for the performance of control of foodstuffs.
Directive 85/591/EEC has fixed general criteria for methods of sampling and analysis.
The provisions for sampling and methods of analysis have been drawn up on the basis of present knowledge and they may be adapted to take account of advances in scientific and technological knowledge.
They do not affect the targeting criteria for sampling as laid down in Commission Decision 98/179/EC of 23 February 1998 laying down detailed rules on official sampling for the monitoring of certain substances and residues thereof in live animals and animal products (8).
Requirements should therefore be laid down as regards the methods of analysis to be used for the determination of dioxin-like PCBs in foodstuffs.
It is therefore appropriate to establish strict requirements for the confirmatory methods of analysis and minimum requirements for the screening method.
The Member States shall ensure that the sampling for the official control of the levels of dioxins and furans and the determination of the levels of dioxin-like PCBs in foodstuffs is carried out in accordance with the methods described in Annex I.
Member States shall bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive by 28 February 2003 at the latest.
METHODS OF SAMPLING FOR OFFICIAL CONTROL OF THE LEVELS OF DIOXINS (PCDD/PCDF) AND THE DETERMINATION OF DIOXIN-LIKE PCBs IN CERTAIN FOODSTUFFS
Aggregate samples thus obtained shall be considered as representative of the lots or sublots from which they are taken.
Lot: an identifiable quantity of food delivered at one time and determined by the official to have common characteristics, such as origin, variety, type of packing, packer, consignor or markings.
Sublot: designated part of a large lot in order to apply the sampling method on that designated part.
Incremental sample: a quantity of material taken from a single place in the lot or sublot.
Table WHO TEFs for human risk assessment based on the conclusions of the World Health Organisation meeting in Stockholm, Sweden, 15-18 June 1997 (Van den Berg et al.
Sampling shall be performed by an authorised qualified person as specified by the Member States.
In the course of sampling and preparation of laboratory samples precautions must be taken to avoid any changes, which would affect the content of dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs, adversely affect the analytical determination or make the aggregate samples unrepresentative.
Departure from this procedure must be recorded in the record provided for under 3.8.
The aggregate sample is made up by uniting all incremental samples.
Subdivision of aggregate sample in laboratory samples for enforcement, defence and referee purposes
Packaging and transmission of aggregate and laboratory samples
All necessary precautions shall be taken to avoid change of composition of the aggregate and laboratory samples, which might arise during transportation or storage.
Each sample taken for official use shall be sealed at the place of sampling and identified following the Member States' regulations.
The sampling method applied shall ensure that the aggregate sample is representative for the lot that is to be controlled.
Reference to the lot number shall be given.
The aggregate sample uniting all incremental samples shall be at least 1 kg (see point 3.5).
The weight of an incremental sample should be at least 100 grams.
In accordance with the provisions of Commission Decision 97/747/EC of 27 October 1997 fixing the levels and frequencies of sampling provided for by Council Directive 96/23/EC for the monitoring of certain substances and residues thereof in certain animal products (1), the sample size for hen eggs is at least 12 eggs (for bulk lots as well for lots consisting of individual packages, Tables 1 and 2).
If the lot consists of individual packages, then the number of packages, which shall be taken to form the aggregate sample, is given in Table 2.
Compliance of the lot or sublot with the specification
The lot is accepted if the result of the first analysis is more than 20 % below the maximum level or, where duplicate analysis is necessary, if the mean conforms to the respective maximum level as laid down in Regulation (EC) No 466/2001.
These requirements should be applied where foodstuffs are analysed for the official control of the levels of dioxins (polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDD) and polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDF)) and the determination of dioxin-like PCBs.
The concentration of dioxins in those samples with significant levels needs to be determined/ confirmed by a confirmatory method.
These methods have a capacity for a high sample throughput and are used to sift large numbers of samples for potential positives.
Confirmatory methods are methods that provide full or complementary information enabling the dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs to be identified and quantified unequivocally at the level of interest.
The concept of âupperbound requires using the limit of quantification for the contribution of each non-quantified congener to the TEQ.
The concept of âmediumbound requires using half of the limit of quantification calculating the contribution of each non-quantified congener to the TEQ.
Measures must be taken to avoid cross-contamination at each stage of the sampling and analysis procedure.
Traces of paper dust must be removed from the sample container.
The sample storage and transportation has to be performed in a way that maintains the integrity of the foodstuff sample.
Perform a blank analysis by carrying out the entire analytical procedure omitting only the sample.
There are many satisfactory specific sample preparation procedures, which may be used for the products under consideration.
Laboratories shall demonstrate the performance of a method in the range of the level of interest, e.g. 0,5 , 1  and 2  the level of interest with an acceptable coefficient of variation for repeated analysis.
Limit of quantification for a confirmatory method should be in the range of about one fifth of the level of interest, to make sure that acceptable coefficients of variations are met in the range of the level of interest.
Successful participation in interlaboratory studies that assess laboratory proficiency is the best way to prove the competence in specific analyses.
Therefore, the continuous participation in interlaboratory studies for the determination of dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs in the relevant feed/food matrices is mandatory.
Laboratories should be accredited following the ISO/IEC/ standard.
Basic requirements for acceptance of analytical procedures:
For PCDDs and PCDFs, detectable quantities have to be in the picogram TEQ (10-12 g) range because of extreme toxicity of some of these compounds.
For most PCB congeners sensitivity in the nanogram (10-9 g) range is already sufficient. However, for the measurement of the more toxic dioxin-like PCB congeners (in particular non-ortho substituted congeners), the same sensitivity must be reached as for the PCDDs and PCDFs.
For gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) methods a differentiation among various congeners is necessary, such as between toxic (e.g. the seventeen 2,3,7,8-substituted PCDDs and PCDFs and dioxin-like PCBs) and other congeners.
High accuracy (trueness and precision).
High accuracy (accuracy of the measurement: the closeness of the agreement between the result of a measurement with the true or assigned value of the measurement) is necessary to avoid the rejection of a sample analysis result on the basis of poor reliability of the estimate of TEQ.
Following criteria have to be complied with on total TEQ value:
Addition of 13C-labelled 2,3,7,8-chlorine substituted internal PCDD/F standards (and of 13C-labelled internal dioxin-like PCB standards, if dioxin-like PCBs have to be determined) must be carried out at the very beginning or start of the analytical method e.g. prior to extraction in order to validate the analytical procedure.
There is a clear preference, certainly in case of confirmatory methods, of using all 17 13C-labelled 2,3,7,8-substituted internal PCDD/F standards and all 12 13C-labelled internal dioxin-like PCB standard (if dioxin-like PCBs have to be determined).
For foodstuffs of plant origin and foodstuffs of animal origin containing less than 10 % fat, the addition of the internal standards is mandatory prior to extraction.
An appropriate validation of the extraction efficiency should be carried out, depending on the stage at which internal standards are introduced and on whether results are reported on product or fat basis.
Control of recovery is necessary.
Lower or higher recoveries for individual congeners, in particular for some hepta- and octa- chlorinated dibenzodioxins and dibenzofurans, are acceptable on the condition that their contribution to the TEQ value does not exceed 10 % of the total TEQ value (based on PCDD/F only).
Separation of dioxins from interfering chlorinated compounds such as PCBs and chlorinated diphenyl ethers should be carried out by suitable chromatographic techniques (preferably with a florisil, alumina and/or carbon column).
Determination should be performed according to EPA Method 1613 revision B: Tetra- through octa-chlorinated dioxins and furans by isotope dilution HRGC/HRMS or another with equivalent performance criteria.
For foodstuffs with a low fat content, the same requirements for contamination levels of about 1 pg WHO-TEQ/g product have to be applied.
Different analytical approaches can be performed using a screening method: a pure screening approach and a quantitative approach.
Samples with a response less than the reference are declared negative, those with a higher response are suspected positives.
The reference sample must show a clearly elevated response in comparison to a blank.
When testing other matrices, the suitability of the reference sample(s) has to be demonstrated, preferentially by including samples shown by HRGC/HRMS to contain a TEQ level around that of the reference sample or else a blank spiked at this level.
For bioassays, the target compounds, possible interferences and maximum tolerable blank levels should be defined.
The result may be expressed as TEQ, thereby assuming that the compounds responsible for the signal correspond to the TEQ principle.
It is essential to note that part of the apparent recovery loss may be due to matrix effects and/or differences between the TEF values in the bioassays and the official TEF values set by WHO.
GC/MS methods of analysis and bioassays may be used for screening.
For cell based bioassays specific requirements are laid down in point 7.3 and for kit-based bioassays in point 7.4.
Actual false negative rates should be under 1 %.
Positive results have always to be confirmed by a confirmatory method of analysis (HRGC/HRMS).
Information on correspondence between bioassay and HRGC/HRMS results should be made available.
When performing a bioassay, every test run requires a series of reference concentrations of TCDD or a dioxin/furan mixture (full dose-response curve with a R2 > 0,95).
TCDD reference concentration (about 3  limit of quantification) on a quality control sheet should be used for the outcome of the bioassay over a constant time period.
Quality control (QC) charts for each type of reference material should be recorded and checked to make sure the outcome is in accordance with the stated guidelines.
Samples above the linear portion of the response curve must be diluted and re-tested.
The percent standard deviation should not be above 15 % in a triplicate determination for each sample dilution and not above 30 % between three independent experiments.
Another approach is to apply a response that is above the background (induction factor 5  the solvent blank) calculated from the calibration curve of the day.
Specific requirements for kit-based bioassays (1)
Test kits should not be used after the expiration date.
Test kits should be kept within the specified range of storage temperature and used at the specified operating temperature.
Reference standards should be used for tests at the laboratory to make sure that the responsiveness to the standard is within an acceptable range.
The report should also include the lipid content of the sample as well the method used for lipid extraction.
No evidence have yet been submitted of commercially available kit-based bioassays having sufficient sensitivity and reliability to be used for screening for the presence of dioxins at the required levels in samples of foodstuffs and feedingstuffs.
establishing a European Maritime Safety Agency
Acting in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 251 of the Treaty (4),
In order to be effective, such legislation must be applied in a proper and uniform manner throughout the Community.
Indeed, there is a need for technical and scientific support and a high level of stable expertise to properly apply the Community legislation in the fields of maritime safety and ship pollution prevention, to monitor its implementation and to evaluate the effectiveness of the measures in place.
In general terms, the Agency should represent the technical body providing the Community with the necessary means to act effectively to enhance overall maritime safety and ship pollution prevention rules.
For the proper achievement of the purposes for which the Agency is established, it is appropriate that the Agency carries out a number of other important tasks aimed at enhancing maritime safety and ship pollution prevention in the waters of the Member States.
It should facilitate cooperation between the Member States and the Commission as provided for in Directive 2002/59/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 June 2002 establishing a Community vessel traffic monitoring and information system and repealing Council Directive 93/75/EEC (5), namely by developing and operating any information system necessary for the objectives of that Directive, and in the activities concerning the investigations related to serious maritime accidents.
It should place the Community maritime safety know-how at the disposal of the States applying for accession.
Opinion of the European Parliament of 14 June 2001 (OJ C 53 E, 28.2.2002, p. 312),
The Agency should favour the establishment of better cooperation between the Member States and should develop and disseminate best practices in the Community.
In order properly to carry out the tasks entrusted to the Agency, it is appropriate that its officials carry out visits to the Member States in order to monitor the overall functioning of the Community maritime safety and ship pollution prevention system.
The Agency should apply the relevant Community legislation concerning public access to documents and the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data.
For the contractual liability of the Agency, which is governed by the law applicable to the contracts concluded by the Agency, the Court of Justice should have jurisdiction to give judgment pursuant to any arbitration clause contained in the contract.
In order to effectively ensure the accomplishment of the functions of the Agency, the Member States and the Commission should be represented on an Administrative Board entrusted with the necessary powers to establish the budget, verify its execution, adopt the appropriate financial rules, establish transparent working procedures for decision making by the Agency, approve its work programme, examine requests for technical assistance from Member States, define a policy for visits to the Member States and appoint the Executive Director.
In order further to ensure the highest level of expertise and experience in the Administrative Board and with a view to involving the sectors most closely concerned in the tasks of the Agency, the Commission should nominate independent professionals from these sectors as board members without the right to vote, on the basis of their personal merit and experience in the field of maritime safety and prevention of pollution by ships and not as representatives of particular professional organisations.
To this end, the Executive Director should prepare and take all necessary steps to ensure the proper accomplishment of the working programme of the Agency, should prepare each year a draft general report to be submitted to the Administrative Board, should draw up estimates of the revenues and expenditure of the Agency and should implement the budget.
Over the past years, as more decentralised agencies have been created, the budgetary authority has looked to improve transparency and control over the management of the Community funding allocated to them, in particular concerning the budgetisation of the fees, financial control, power of discharge, pension scheme contributions and the internal budgetary procedure (code of conduct).
Within five years from the date of the Agency having taken up its responsibilities, the Administrative Board should commission an independent external evaluation in order to assess the impact of this Regulation, the Agency and its working practices on establishing a high level of maritime safety and prevention of pollution by ships,
The Agency shall provide the Member States and the Commission with the technical and scientific assistance needed and with a high level of expertise, in order to help them to apply Community legislation properly in the field of maritime safety and prevention of pollution by ships, to monitor its implementation and to evaluate the effectiveness of the measures in place.
it shall assist the Commission, where appropriate, in the preparatory works for updating and developing Community legislation in the field of maritime safety and prevention of pollution by ships, in particular in line with the development of international legislation in that field.
it shall assist the Commission in the effective implementation of Community legislation on maritime safety and prevention of pollution by ships throughout the Community.
monitor the overall functioning of the Community port State control regime, which may include visits to the Member States, and suggest to the Commission any possible improvements in that field;
assist the Commission in the performance of any task assigned to the Commission by existing and future Community legislation on maritime safety and ship pollution prevention, notably legislation applicable to classification societies, the safety of passenger ships, as well as that applicable to the safety, training, certification and watchkeeping of ships' crews;
organise, where appropriate, relevant training activities in fields which are the responsibility of the port State and flag State;
shall facilitate cooperation between the Member States and the Commission in the field covered by Directive 2002/59/EC.
develop and operate any information system necessary for attaining the objectives of that Directive;
it shall provide the Commission and the Member States with objective, reliable and comparable information and data on maritime safety and on pollution by ships to enable them to take the necessary steps to improve maritime safety and prevention of pollution by ships and to evaluate the effectiveness of existing measures.
On the basis of the data collected, the Agency shall assist the Commission in the publication, every six months, of information relating to ships that have been refused access to Community ports pursuant to Council Directive 95/21/EC of 19 June 1995 concerning the enforcement, in respect of shipping using Community ports and sailing in the waters under the jurisdiction of the Member States, of international standards for ship safety, pollution prevention and shipboard living and working conditions (port State control) (1).
the course of negotiations with States applying for accession the Agency may provide technical assistance as regards the implementation of Community legislation in the field of maritime safety and prevention of pollution by ships.
In order to perform the tasks entrusted to it, the Agency may carry out visits to the Member States in accordance with the policy defined by the Administrative Board.
The Agency shall inform the Member State concerned of the planned visit, the names of the delegated officials, and the date on which the visit starts.
At the end of each visit, the Agency shall draw up a report and send it to the Commission and to the Member State concerned.
The Agency shall apply the principles of Regulation (EC) No of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 May 2001 regarding public access to European Parliament, Council and Commission documents (2), when handling applications for access to documents held by it.
It shall ensure in particular that the public and any interested party are rapidly given objective, reliable and easily understandable information with regard to its work.
The information collected in accordance with this Regulation by the Commission and the Agency shall be subject to Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2000 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data by the Community institutions and bodies and on the free movement of such data (3).
It shall have legal personality.
It may in particular, acquire or dispose of movable and immovable property and may be a party to legal proceedings.
The Agency shall be represented by its Executive Director.
The Administrative Board, in agreement with the Commission, shall adopt the necessary detailed rules of application.
The Agency's staff shall consist of officials assigned or seconded by the Commission or Member States on a temporary basis and of other servants recruited by the Agency as necessary to carry out its tasks.
The contractual liability of the Agency shall be governed by the law applicable to the contract in question.
In the case of non-contractual liability, the Agency shall, in accordance with the general principles common to the laws of the Member States, make good any damage caused by its departments or by its servants in the performance of their duties.
The personal liability of its servants towards the Agency shall be governed by the provisions laid down in the Staff Regulations or Conditions of employment applicable to them.
The translation services required for the functioning of the Agency shall be provided by the Translation Centre of the bodies of the European Union.

The President M. ARIAS CAÃETE
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 July 2000 on a revised Community eco-label award scheme (1), and in particular the second subparagraph of Article 6(1) thereof,
Regulation (EC) No provides that specific eco-label criteria are to be established according to product groups.
It is appropriate to revise the ecological criteria that were established by Commission Decision 1999/476/EC of 10 June 1999 establishing ecological criteria for the award of the Community eco-label to laundry detergents (2) in order to reflect the developments in the market.
A new Decision should be adopted establishing the specific ecological criteria for this product group, which will be valid for a period of five years.
The measures provided for in this Decision are based on the draft criteria developed by the European Union Eco-labelling Board established under Article 13 of Regulation (EC) No.
In order to be awarded the Community eco-label under Regulation (EC) No , a laundry detergent must fall within the product group âlaundry detergents as defined in Article 2, and must comply with the ecological criteria set out in the Annex to this Decision.
For administrative purposes the product group code number assigned to this product group shall be â6.
The product group definition and the specific ecological criteria for the product group shall be valid until 31 August 2004.
Producers of products falling within the product group âlaundry detergents which have already been awarded the eco-label before 1 March 2003 may continue to use that label until 31 August 2004.
In these cases the label may be used until 31 August 2004.
These criteria aim in particular at promoting:
reduction of water pollution by reducing the volume of total chemicals used in the products and by limiting the use of potentially hazardous ingredients,
Additionally, the criteria enhance the consumers' environmental awareness.
The specific assessment and verification requirements are indicated within each criterion.
Where possible, the testing should be performed by laboratories that meet the general requirements of EN ISO 17025 or equivalent.
The concentration of ingredients in the product, which implies a requirement for documentation of compliance with the ecological criteria, is generally defined at â¥ 0,1 % by weight of the preparation.
Appendix IA. presents the detergent ingredient database (DID list) which contains the most widely used ingredients used in detergent formulations.
Where appropriate, the applicant may use subsequent revisions of the detergent ingredient database as they become available.
The Competent Bodies are recommended to take into account the implementation of recognised environmental management schemes, such as EMAS or ISO 14001, when assessing applications and monitoring compliance with the criteria (note: it is not required to implement such management schemes).
The functional unit is expressed in g/wash (grams per wash).
The dosage recommended by the manufacturer to consumers for the water hardness of 2,5 mmol CaCO3/l and ânormally soiled textiles is taken as the reference dosage for the calculation of the ecological criteria, and the test of washing performance.
The amount of total chemicals shall not exceed 100 g/wash.
The total amount of insoluble inorganic ingredients at the recommended dosage shall be less than 30 g/wash.
where weight (i) is the weight of the ingredient per recommended dose, LF is the loading factor and LTE is the long-term toxicity effect concentration of the ingredient.
The CDVtox of the recommended dosage shall not exceed 4,500 l/wash.
The total amount of phosphates (as sodium tripolyphosphate-STPP) at the recommended dosage shall not exceed 25 g/ wash.
Assessment and verification: the exact formulation of the product shall be provided to the Competent Body.
For surfactants which are not included in the DID list, the relevant information from literature or other sources, or appropriate test results, showing that they are aerobically biodegradable shall be provided.
The 10 days window principle shall not apply. The pass levels shall be 70 % for the tests referred to in Annex V.C4(A) and C4(B) of Directive 67/548/EEC (and their equivalent OECD 301 A and E tests and ISO equivalents), and shall be 60 % for tests C4-C, D, E and F (and their equivalent OECD 301 B, C, D and F tests and ISO equivalents).
Assessment and verification: the exact formulation of the product shall be provided.

THOD for aerobically non degradable organic substances is set to zero.
LTE = long term effect concentration.
CF = correction factor for anaerobic non degradable organic substances.
The lowest validated long-term effect (LTE) data on fish, daphnia magna or algae should be considered for the calculation of the critical dilution volume criterion (toxicity).
In the absence of LTE data the following procedure has to be applied in order to estimate the LTE data by using the specified uncertainty factor (UF) on the data of the most sensitive species:
NOEC is the no observed effect concentration (in a chronic toxicity test).
Such a rule can be applied only within a group of homologues.
Any deviation from the described scheme has to be well reasoned for the specific chemical.
Non- biodegradable organics (anaerobic): flow diagram to define correction factors (CF) (1)
The following approach may be used to provide the necessary documentation of anaerobic degradability in the case of ingredients that are not listed in the DID list.
If new testing is necessary, perform a screening test by use of ISO 11734, ECETOC No 28 (June 1988) or an equivalent method.
Testing at low dosages may be performed by use of OECD 308 (August 2000) or an equivalent method.
Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee (1),
Such protection would benefit transport users, the economy and society as a whole.
The maritime security measures imposed by that Regulation constitute only part of the measures necessary to achieve an adequate level of security throughout maritime-linked transport chains.
These measures should apply to all those ports in which one or more port facilities covered by Regulation (EC) No 725/2004 are situated.
Member States should rely upon detailed security assessments to identify the exact boundaries of the security-relevant port area, as well as the different measures required to ensure appropriate port security.
Member States should approve port security plans which incorporate the findings of the port security assessment.
This clear division of tasks and the recording of exercise procedures in the format of the port security plan is considered to contribute strongly to the effectiveness of both preventive and remedial port security measures.
Adequate measures should be taken on the basis of risk assessments which ensure that cars and goods vehicles destined for transport on roll-on roll-off vessels on domestic and international routes do not cause a risk to the vessel, its passengers and crew or to the cargo.
Member States should ensure that responsibilities in port security are clearly recognised by all parties involved.
Member States should approve assessments and plans and monitor their implementation in their ports.
Member States should ensure that a focal point for port security takes up the role of contact point between the Commission and Member States.
The effective and standard implementation of measures under this security policy raises important questions in relation to its funding.
By 30 June 2006, the Commission should submit to the European Parliament and the Council the findings of a study on the costs involved in measures taken under this Directive, addressing in particular the way financing is shared between the public authorities, port authorities and operators.
The measures necessary for the implementation of this Directive should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission (1).
Since this Directive concerns seaports, the obligations herein contained should not be applicable to Austria, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Luxembourg or Slovakia,
This Directive shall also ensure that security measures taken pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 725/2004 benefit from enhanced port security.
common basic rules on port security measures;
This Directive lays down security measures which shall be observed in ports.
The measures laid down in this Directive shall apply to every port located in the territory of a Member State in which one or more port facilities covered by an approved port facility security plan pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 725/2004 is or are situated.
Member States shall define for each port the boundaries of the port for the purposes of this Directive, appropriately taking into account information resulting from the port security assessment.
'port' means any specified area of land and water, with boundaries defined by the Member State in which the port is situated, containing works and equipment designed to facilitate commercial maritime transport operations;
'port' facility means a location where the ship/port interface takes place; this includes areas such as anchorages, waiting berths and approaches from sea- ward, as appropriate;
'port security authority' means the authority responsible for security matters in a given port.
Member States shall ensure that port security measures introduced by this Directive are closely coordinated with measures taken pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 725/2004.
A port security authority may be designated for more than one port.
Member States may designate a âcompetent authority for maritime security provided for under Regulation (EC) No 725/2004 as port security authority.
These assessments shall take due account of the specificities of different sections of a port and, where deemed applicable by the relevant authority of the Member State, of its adjacent areas if these have an impact on security in the port and shall take into account the assessments for port facilities within their boundaries as carried out pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 725/2004.
Port security assessments may be carried out by a recognised security organisation as referred to in Article 11.
Subject to the findings of port security assessments, Member States shall ensure that port security plans are developed, maintained and updated.
Port security plans shall identify, for each of the different security levels referred to in Article 8:
the measures to be put in place;
Each port security plan shall take into account as a minimum the detailed requirements specified in Annex II.
In the case of international maritime transport services, the Member States concerned shall cooperate in the security assessment.
Port security plans shall be approved by the Member State concerned before implementation.
The monitoring shall be coordinated with other control activities carried out in the port.
Member States shall introduce a system of security levels for ports or parts of ports.
'Security level 1' means the level for which minimum appropriate protective security measures shall be maintained at all times;
'Security level 3' means the level for which further specific protective security measures shall be maintained for a limited period of time when a security incident is probable or imminent, although it may not be possible to identify the specific target.
At each security level, a Member State may determine that different security measures are to be implemented in different parts of the port depending on the findings of the port security assessment.
A port security officer shall be approved by the Member State concerned for each port.
Port security officers shall fulfil the role of point of contact for port security related issues.
The scope of the review shall be that of Articles 6 or 7, as appropriate.
Recognised security organisations shall fulfil the conditions set out in Annex IV.
Member States shall appoint for port security aspects a focal point.
The focal point for port security shall communicate to the Commission the list of ports concerned by this Directive and shall inform it of any changes to that list.
The Commission shall, in cooperation with the focal points referred to in Article 12, monitor the implementation of this Directive by Member States.
Annexes I to IV may be amended in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 15(2), without broadening the scope of this Directive.
Where reference is made to this paragraph, Articles 5 and 7 of Decision 1999/468/EC shall apply, having regard to the provisions of Article 8 thereof.
Confidentiality and dissemination of information
Member States shall take equivalent measures in accordance with relevant national legislation.
Member States shall bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive by 15 June 2007.
and the effectiveness of the measures taken.
This Directive shall enter into force on the 20th day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.
For the European Parliament, J. BORRELL FONTELLES

Having regard to Council Directive 90/377/EEC concerning a Community procedure to improve the transparency of gas and electricity prices charged to industrial end-users (1), and in particular Article 6 thereof,
Directive 90/377/EEC should therefore be amended accordingly.
The Annexes to Directive 90/377/EEC are replaced by the text in the Annex to this Decision.
For the Commission Andris PIEBALGS Member of the Commission
Prices to be reported are prices paid by industrial end-users buying natural gas distributed through mains for their own use.
However, the system excludes consumers who use gas:
non-energy uses (e.g. in the chemical industry),
Prices will be collected twice per year, at the beginning of each six-month period, (January and July) and will refer to the average prices paid by industrial end-users for gas over the previous six months.
Prices must be expressed in national currency per gigajoule.
Prices must include all charges payable: network charges plus energy consumed minus any rebates or premiums, plus other charges (meter rental, standing charges, etc.).
The Member States develop and implement cost-effective procedures to ensure a representative data compilation system based on the following rules:
Arithmetic average prices will be provided only when weighted figures cannot be calculated.
Market shares should be based on the quantity of gas invoiced by the gas supply undertakings to industrial end- users.
In the interest of confidentiality, data relating to prices will be communicated only where there are, in the Member State concerned, at least three end-users in each of the categories referred to under point (j).
Prices excluding taxes and levies.
Prices including all taxes, levies and VAT.
Once every two years, together with the January price reporting, information about the compilation system applied will be communicated to the Statistical Office of the European Communities and particularly: a description of the survey and its scope (number of supply undertakings surveyed, aggregated percentage of the market represented, etc.) and the criteria used to calculate weighted average prices as well as the aggregated consumption volumes represented by each band.
Once per year, together with the January price reporting, information about the main average characteristics and factors affecting the prices reported for each consumption band will be communicated to the Statistical Office of the European Communities.
A description on discounts given for interruptible supplies.
Once per year, together with the January reporting, the rates and method of calculation as well as a description of the taxes levied on gas sales to industrial end-users should also be reported.
The description of taxes to be provided will include three clearly separated sections:
The items described under this point will be included under the reported figures for the price level: âPrices excluding taxes and leviesâ.
The items described under this point will therefore be included under the reported figures for the price level: âPrices excluding VAT and other recoverable taxesâ.
The items described under this point will be included under the reported figures for the price level: âPrices including all taxes, levies and VATâ.
This usually refers either to the promotion of renewable energy sources or CHP or as a burden for CO2, SO2 or another agent emissions related to climate change.
Other taxes or levies not linked with the energy sector: national, local or regional fiscal taxes on energy consumed, taxes on gas distribution, etc.
In Member States where one company covers all the industrial sales, the information may be communicated by that company.
Electricity prices for industrial end-users (1) to be collected and compiled according to the following methodology:
All industrial uses of electricity are considered.
Prices will be collected twice per year, at the beginning of each six-month period, (January and July) and will refer to the average prices paid by the industrial end-user for electricity over the previous six months.
The Member States develop and implement cost-effective procedures to ensure a representative data compilation system based on the following rules:
Arithmetic average prices will be provided only when weighted figures cannot be calculated.
Market shares should be based on the quantity of electricity invoiced by electricity supply undertakings to industrial end-users.
Electricity prices will be surveyed for the following categories of industrial end-user:
The information to be provided will include:
Once per year, together with the January price reporting, the rates and method of calculation as well as a description of the taxes levied on electricity sales to industrial end-users should be reported.
The description on taxes to be provided will include three clearly separated sections:
The items described under this point will be included under the reported figures for the price level: âPrices excluding VAT and other recoverable taxesâ.
This usually refers to licences and fees for the occupation of land and public or private property by networks or other electricity devices.
Nuclear and other Inspection taxes: nuclear decommissioning charges, inspection and fees for nuclear installations, etc.
Taxes on income, property related taxes, excise duties on oil products and fuels other than for electricity generation, oil for motor cars, road taxes, taxes on licences for telecom, radio, advertising, fees for licences, taxes on waste, etc. will not be taken into consideration and are excluded from this description, because they are undoubtedly part of the operators costs and apply to other industries or activities.
This breakdown of electricity prices into their main components will be based on the following methodology:
If separate volumes of kWh per band are not available, estimates should be provided.
For this component an additional breakdown will be provided:
Taxes and levies on âEnergy and Supplyâ prices.
NOTE: If complementary services are identified separately, then they can be allocated into one of the two main components as follows:
âEnergy and Supplyâ price will include the following costs: generation, aggregation, balancing energy, supplied energy costs, customer services, after-sales management, metering, and other supply costs.
If this kind of costs exists, they will be reported separately.
laying down the methods of sampling and analysis for the official control of the levels of lead, cadmium, mercury, inorganic tin, 3-MCPD and benzo(a)pyrene in foodstuffs
Council Regulation (EEC) No 315/93 of 8 February 1993 laying down Community procedures for contaminants in food (2) provides that maximum levels must be set for certain contaminants in foodstuffs in order to protect public health.
Regulation (EC) No 882/2004 lays down general principles for the official control of foodstuffs.
The methods of sampling and analysis to be used for the official control of levels of lead, cadmium, mercury, 3- MCPD, inorganic tin and benzo(a)pyrene in certain food- stuffs are established in Commission Directive 2001/22/EC of 8 March 2001 laying down the sampling methods and the methods of analysis for the official control of the levels of lead, cadmium, mercury and 3-MCPD in foodstuffs ( 4 ),
( 5 ) and Commission Directive 2005/10/EC of 4 February 2005 laying down the sampling methods and the methods of analysis for the official control of the levels of benzo(a)pyrene in foodstuffs ( 6 ), respectively.
Therefore, in the interest of clarity of legislation, it is appropriate to merge those provisions in one single legislative act.
The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee for the Food Chain and Animal Health,
Paragraph 1 shall apply without prejudice to the provisions of Regulation (EC) No 882/2004.
References to the repealed Directives shall be construed as references to this Regulation.
For the Commission Markos KYPRIANOU Member of the Commission
'lot': an identifiable quantity of food delivered at one time and determined by the official to have common characteristics, (such as origin, variety, type of packing, packer, consignor or markings).
'aggregate sample': the combined total of all the incremental samples taken from the lot or sublot; aggregate samples shall be considered as representative of the lots or sublots from which they are taken;
Sampling shall be performed by an authorised person as designated by the Member State.
Precautions to be taken the course of sampling, precautions shall be taken to avoid any changes which would affect the levels of contaminants, adversely affect the analytical determination or make the aggregate samples unrepresentative.
The aggregate sample shall be made up by combining the incremental samples.
Each sample shall be placed in a clean, inert container offering adequate protection from contamination, from loss of analytes by adsorption to the internal wall of the container and against damage in transit.
Sealing and labelling of samples
A record shall be kept of each sampling, permitting each lot or sublot to be identified unambiguously (reference to the lot number shall be given) and giving the date and place of sampling together with any additional information likely to be of assistance to the analyst.
For products traded in bulk consignments (e.g. cereals), Table 1 shall apply.
The aggregate sample shall be at least 1 kg or 1 litre except where it is not possible e.g. when the sample consists of 1 package or unit.
In the case of bulk liquid products the lot or sublot shall be thoroughly mixed in so far as possible and in so far it does not affect the quality of the product, by either manual or mechanical means immediately prior to sampling.
It is therefore sufficient to take three incremental samples from a lot or sublot to form the aggregate sample.
The weight of an incremental sample shall be at least 100 grams or 100 millilitres, resulting in an aggregate sample of at least about 1 kg or 1 litre.
The maximum levels for inorganic tin apply to the contents of each can, but for practical reasons it is necessary to use an aggregate sampling approach.
Laboratories shall comply with the provisions of Article 12 of Regulation (EC) No 882/2004 (1).
Laboratories shall be able to demonstrate that they have internal quality control procedures in place.
The basic requirement is to obtain a representative and homogeneous laboratory sample without introducing secondary contamination.
Specific procedures for lead, cadmium , mercury and inorganic tin
Wherever possible, apparatus and equipment coming into contact with the sample shall not contain those metals to be determined and be made of inert materials e.g. plastics such as polypropylene, polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) etc.
There are many satisfactory specific sample preparation procedures which may be used for the products under consideration.
Wherever possible, apparatus and equipment coming into contact with the sample shall be made of inert materials such as aluminium, glass or polished stainless steel.
Treatment of the sample as received in the laboratory
The following definitions shall apply:
sr = Standard deviation calculated from results generated under repeatability conditions.
R = Reproducibility: the value below which the absolute difference between single test results obtained under reproducibility conditions (i.e., on identical material obtained by operators in different laboratories, using the standardised test method), may be expected to lie within a certain probability (typically 95 %); R = 2,8  sR.
RSDR = Relative standard deviation calculated from results generated under reproducibility conditions [(sR/ x )  100].
The limit of detection is numerically equal to three times the standard deviation of the mean of blank determinations (n > 20).
If both accuracy and precision are constant over a concentration range around the limit of detection, then the limit of quantification is numerically equal to six or 10 times the standard deviation of the mean of blank determinations (n > 20).
HORRATR = The observed RSDR value divided by the RSDR value calculated from the Horwitz equation.
Uf = Maximum standard measurement uncertainty.
For the analysis of lead in wine, Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2676/90 (2) lays down the method to be used in chapter 35 of its Annex.
Performance criteria for methods of analysis for lead, cadmium, mercury and inorganic tin
Methods suitable for official control must produce results with standard measurement uncertainties less than the maximum standard measurement uncertainty calculated using the formula below:
the concentration of interest (Î¼g/kg);
The values to be used are given in Table 8.
The results shall be expressed in the same units and with the same number of significant figures as the maximum levels laid down in Regulation (EC) No.
In this case the level of recovery must be reported.
In case the result is reported uncorrected for recovery this shall be mentioned.
The analyst shall note the âReport on the relationship between analytical results, measurement uncertainty, recovery factors and the provisions in EU food and feed legislation (1).
The lot or sublot is rejected if the analytical result of the laboratory sample exceeds beyond reasonable doubt the respective maximum level as laid down in Regulation (EC) No taking into account the expanded measurement uncertainty and correction of the result for recovery if an extraction step has been applied in the analytical method used.
DECISION No /EC OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL
After consulting the Committee of the Regions,
However, risks to children and abuse of these technologies continue to exist and, as a result of changing technologies and societal behaviours, new risks and abuses continue to emerge.
The Commission Communication âi2010 - A European Information Society for growth and employment (COM(), developing the Lisbon strategy, seeks to ensure coherence across the Commission's information society and media policies in order to reinforce the significant contribution of information and communication technologies to the performance of the economies of Member States.
The Community legislative framework addressing the challenges of digital content in the Information Society includes provisions on the protection of minors (3), the protection of privacy (4) and the liability of intermediary service providers (5).
Recommendation 2006/952/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 December 2006 on the protection of minors and human dignity and on the right of reply in relation to the competitiveness of the European audio visual and on-line information services industry (7) builds on Council Recommendation 98/560/EC of 24 September 1998 on the development of the competitiveness of the European audiovisual and information services industry by promoting national frameworks aimed at achieving a comparable and effective level of protection of minors and human dignity (8), by setting out guidelines for the development of national self-regulation, and extending its scope to include media literacy, cooperation and the sharing of experience and best practices between regulatory, self-regulatory, and co-regulatory bodies and measures to combat discrimination in all media.
Action should also be aimed at preventing children from being victimised by threats, harassment and humiliation via the Internet and/or interactive digital technologies, including mobile phones.
In addition to the findings of the evaluations of the predecessor programmes, a series of Eurobarometer surveys and a public consultation have clearly identified the need to maintain the activities on reporting illegal content and on awareness-raising in the Member States.
Evolving technologies, changes in the way the Internet and other communication technologies are used by adults and children, and shifts in societal behaviours are leading to new risks for children.
Several measures and actions should be combined in a multi-faceted and complementary way; this should include, for example, taking measures to promote a safe and responsible use of the Internet, further developing supporting technologies, promoting best practices for codes of conduct embodying generally agreed standards of behaviour and cooperating with industry on the agreed objectives of those codes.
The changing media landscape, resulting from new technologies and media innovation, makes it necessary to teach children, as well as parents, carers, teachers and educators, to use on-line information services safely and effectively.
International cooperation is essential given the global nature of the problem.
International cooperation, which has been stimulated through the Community networking structures, should be reinforced in order to better protect children against cross-border risks involving third countries.
All the Member States have ratified the 20 November 1989 UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, pursuant to which signatory States are required to adopt any national, bilateral and multilateral measure needed to prevent any form of child exploitation, and to adopt any legislative, administrative and other measure necessary for the purpose of upholding the rights recognised under that Convention, where appropriate by means of international cooperation.
Such measures should therefore be adopted in accordance with the management procedure provided for in Article 4 of that Decision.
This Decision lays down a financial envelope for the implementation of the Programme constituting the prime reference for the budgetary authority during the annual budgetary procedure, within the meaning of point 37 of the Interinstitutional Agreement of 17 May 2006 between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission on budgetary discipline and sound financial management (1).
In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Decision does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives.
This Decision establishes a Community programme to promote safer use of the Internet and other communication technologies, particularly for children, and to fight against illegal content and harmful conduct online.
The following action lines shall be addressed:
promoting a safer online environment;
The Programme shall be implemented in accordance with Annex III.
Participation in the Programme shall be open to legal entities established in:
accession countries and candidate countries benefiting from a pre-accession strategy, in accordance with the general principles and general terms and conditions for the participation of those countries in Community programmes established in the respective Framework Agreements and Association Council Decisions;
The Programme shall also be open to international organisations and legal entities established in third countries other than those mentioned in points (b) to (e) of paragraph 1 under the conditions set out in Annex III.
The Commission shall prepare annual work programmes on the basis of this Decision.
adopting and modifying the annual work programmes, including determining the priority areas for international cooperation;
implementing measures for evaluating the Programme.
In particular, the Commission shall inform that committee immediately about all selection decisions taken on matters falling outside of the scope of paragraph 4 of this Article.
The period laid down in Article 4(3) of Decision 1999/468/EC shall be set at three months.
The Commission shall monitor the implementation of projects under the Programme.
The Commission shall, by 24 June 2011, report to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions, on the implementation of the action lines referred to in Article 1(2).
The Programme shall cover a period of five years from 1 January 2009.
The annual appropriations for the period from 2009 to 2013 shall be authorised by the budgetary authority within the limits of the financial framework.
This Decision shall enter into force on the date of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.
The objective of the Programme is to promote safer use of the Internet and other communication technologies (âonline technologies), to educate users, particularly children, parents, carers, teachers and educators in this regard and to fight against illegal content and harmful conduct online.
The Programme will be implemented through four general action lines:
They will also address the opportunities and risks of services using new distribution platforms, such as audiovisual services using mobile phone networks.
The main planned actions are:
Activities will promote public awareness in a coordinated way across the European Union, by conveying a positive message about the opportunities for a wider and more intensive use of information and communication tech nology, while providing adequate information about risks and ways to deal with them.
Activities will encourage cost-effective means of distributing awareness information to a large number of users, for instance, through cooperation with mass media, through the online distribution of user-generated content and through the educational system.
Providing contact points where parents and children can receive answers to questions about how to stay safe online, including advice on how to deal with both grooming and cyber-bullying.
Actions will be aimed at improving relevant awareness-raising methods and tools so that they are more efficient and cost-effective over the long-term.
Actions will be taken to ensure effective EU cross-border cooperation and effective exchange of best practices, tools, methods, experience and information.
Actions will aim to promote cooperation and exchange of best practices, tools, methods, experience and infomation at international level in order to encourage common approaches and methods of work and improve and enhance the effectiveness, cost-efficiency and the range of global initiatives.

the action must fall under a priority for international cooperation as defined in the annual work programmes.
the annual work programmes may define further criteria and conditions which must be satisfied by international organisations and legal entities established in third countries in order to receive Community funding.
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (1),
In June 2004 the European Council asked for the preparation of an overall strategy to protect critical infrastructures.
The responses received to the Green Paper emphasised the added value of a Community framework concerning critical infrastructure protection.
The importance of the key principles of subsidiarity, proportionality and complementarity, as well as of stakeholder dialogue was emphasised.
Under this approach, man-made, technological threats and natural disasters should be taken into account in the critical infrastructure protection process, but the threat of terrorism should be given priority.
As such, this Directive concentrates on the energy and transport sectors and should be reviewed with a view to assessing its impact and the need to include other sectors within its scope, inter alia, the information and communication technology (âICT) sector.
There are a certain number of critical infrastructures in the Community, the disruption or destruction of which would have significant cross-border impacts.
Such ECIs should be identified and designated by means of a common procedure.
Bilateral schemes for cooperation between Member States in the field of critical infrastructure protection constitute a well-established and efficient means of dealing with transboundary critical infrastructures.
Information pertaining to the designation of a particular infrastructure as an ECI should be classified at an appropriate level in accordance with existing Community and Member State legislation.
Given the very significant private sector involvement in overseeing and managing risks, business continuity planning and post-disaster recovery, a Community approach needs to encourage full private sector involvement.
This Directive complements existing sectoral measures at Community level and in the Member States.
Duplication of, or contradiction between, different acts or provisions should be avoided.
With a view to avoiding unnecessary work and duplication, each Member State should first assess whether the owners/operators of designated ECIs possess relevant OSPs or similar measures.
Measures, principles, guidelines, including Community measures as well as bilateral and/or multilateral cooper ation schemes that provide for a plan similar or equivalent to an OSP or provide for a Security Liaison Officer or equivalent, should be deemed to satisfy the requirements of this Directive in relation to the OSP or the Security Liaison Officer respectively.
With a view to avoiding unnecessary work and duplication, each Member State should first assess whether the owners/operators of designated ECIs already possess a Security Liaison Officer or equivalent.
It is up to each Member State to decide on the most appropriate form of action with regard to the designation of Security Liaison Officers.
The Commission should receive generic information from the Member States concerning risks, threats and vulnerabilities in sectors where ECIs were identified, including where relevant information on possible improvements in the ECIs and cross-sector dependencies, which could be the basis for the development of specific proposals by the Commission on improving the protection of ECIs, where necessary.
Effective protection of ECIs requires communication, coordination, and cooperation at national and Community level.
It is important that the rules of confidentiality according to applicable national law or Regulation (EC) No of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 May 2001 regarding public access to European Parliament, Council and Commission documents (1) are observed with regard to specific facts about critical infrastructure assets, which could be used to plan and act with a view to causing unacceptable consequences for critical infrastructure installations.
Each Member State and the Commission should respect the relevant security classification given by the originator of a document.
The sharing of information requires a relationship of trust such that companies and organisations know that their sensitive and confidential data will be sufficiently protected.
In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives.
This Directive establishes a procedure for the identification and designation of European critical infrastructures (âECIs), and a common approach to the assessment of the need to improve the protection of such infrastructures in order to contribute to the protection of people.
âEuropean critical infrastructure or âECI means critical infrastructure located in Member States the disruption or destruction of which would have a significant impact on at least two Member States.
This includes effects resulting from cross-sector dependencies on other types of infrastructure;
âprotection means all activities aimed at ensuring the functionality, continuity and integrity of critical infrastructures in order to deter, mitigate and neutralise a threat, risk or vulnerability;
Pursuant to the procedure provided in Annex III, each Member State shall identify potential ECIs which both satisfy the cross-cutting and sectoral criteria and meet the definitions set out in Article 2(a) and (b).
Each Member State and the Commission shall continue on an ongoing basis the process of identifying potential ECIs.
casualties criterion (assessed in terms of the potential number of fatalities or injuries);
public effects criterion (assessed in terms of the impact on public confidence, physical suffering and disruption of daily life; including the loss of essential services).
The precise thresholds applicable to the cross-cutting criteria shall be determined on a case-by-case basis by the Member States concerned by a particular critical infrastructure.
The sectoral criteria shall take into account the characteristics of individual ECI sectors.
The criteria shall be classified.
The sectors to be used for the purposes of implementing this Directive shall be the energy and transport sectors.
If deemed appropriate and in conjunction with the review of this Directive as laid down in Article 11, subsequent sectors to be used for the purpose of implementing this Directive may be identified.
Each Member State shall inform the other Member States which may be significantly affected by a potential ECI about its identity and the reasons for designating it as a potential ECI.
The Commission may participate in these discussions but shall not have access to detailed information which would allow for the unequivocal identification of a particular infrastructure.
The Commission shall without delay communicate this wish to the Member State on whose territory the potential ECI is located and endeavour to facilitate agreement between the parties.
The acceptance of the Member State on whose territory the infrastructure to be designated as an ECI is located, shall be required.
Only those Member States that may be significantly affected by an ECI shall know its identity.
Information concerning the designation of an infrastructure as an ECI shall be classified at an appropriate level.
The operator security plan (âOSP) procedure shall identify the critical infrastructure assets of the ECI and which security solutions exist or are being implemented for their protection.
If a Member State finds that such an OSP or equivalent exists and is updated regularly, no further implementation action shall be necessary.
Each Member State shall ensure that the OSP or equivalent is in place and is reviewed regularly within one year following designation of the critical infrastructure as an ECI.
In a case where supervisory or oversight arrangements already exist in relation to an ECI such arrangements are not affected by this Article and the relevant Member State authority referred to in this Article shall be the supervisor under those existing arrangements.
The guidelines for application referred to in Article 3(2) shall contain an indicative list of such measures.
Each Member State shall assess whether each designated ECI located on its territory possesses a Security Liaison Officer or equivalent.
If a Member State finds that a Security Liaison Officer or equivalent does not exist in relation to a designated ECI, it shall ensure by any measures deemed appropriate, that such a Security Liaison Officer or equivalent is designated.
This communication mechanism shall be without prejudice to national requirements concerning access to sensitive and classified information.
Each Member State shall conduct a threat assessment in relation to ECI subsectors within one year following the designation of critical infrastructure on its territory as an ECI within those subsectors.
A common template for these reports may be developed by the Commission in cooperation with the Member States.
Based on the reports referred to in paragraph 2, the Commission and the Member States shall assess on a sectoral basis whether further protection measures at Community level should be considered for ECIs.
Common methodological guidelines for carrying out risk analyses in respect of ECIs may be developed by the Commission in cooperation with the Member States.
Sensitive European critical infrastructure protection-related information
Member States, the Commission and relevant supervisory bodies shall ensure that sensitive European critical infrastructure protection-related information submitted to the Member States or to the Commission is not used for any purpose other than the protection of critical infrastructures.
Each Member State shall appoint a European critical infrastructure protection contact point (âECIP contact point).
The appointment of an ECIP contact point does not preclude other authorities in a Member State from being involved in European critical infrastructure protection issues.
Member States shall take the necessary measures to comply with this Directive by 12 January 2011.
The methods of making such reference shall be laid down by Member States.
Therefore the list of ECI sectors in itself does not generate a generic obligation to designate an ECI in each sector.
The ECI OSP procedure will cover at least:
permanent security measures, which identify indispensable security investments and means which are relevant to be employed at all times.
graduated security measures, which can be activated according to varying risk and threat levels.
requires each Member State to identify the critical infrastructures which may be designated as an ECI.
A potential ECI which does not satisfy the requirements of one of the following sequential steps is considered to be ânon- ECI and is excluded from the procedure.
Each Member State shall apply the sectoral criteria in order to make a first selection of critical infrastructures within a sector.
The significance of the impact will be determined either by using national methods for identifying critical infrastructures or with reference to the cross-cutting criteria, at an appropriate national level.
Each Member State shall apply the transboundary element of the definition of ECI pursuant to Article 2(b) to the potential ECI that has passed the first two steps of this procedure.
Each Member State shall apply the cross-cutting criteria to the remaining potential ECIs.
A potential ECI which does not satisfy the cross-cutting criteria will not be considered to be an ECI.
amending Regulation (EC) No 474/2006 establishing the Community list of air carriers which are subject to an operating ban within the Community
Whereas: Commission Regulation (EC) No 474/2006 of 22 March 2006 established the Community list of air carriers which are subject to an operating ban within the Community referred to in Chapter II of Regulation (EC) No (2).
In accordance with Article 4(3) of Regulation (EC) No , some Member States communicated to the Commission information that is relevant in the context of updating the Community list.
On this basis, the Community list should be updated.
Opportunity was given by the Commission to the air carriers concerned to consult the documents provided by Member States, to submit written comments and to make an oral presentation to the Commission within 10 working days and to the Air Safety Committee established by Council Regulation (EEC) No 3922/91 of 16 December 1991 on the harmonization of technical requirements and administrative procedures in the field of civil aviation (4).
Regulation (EC) No 474/2006 should therefore be amended accordingly.
The report shows that significant progress has been made by the carrier following its inclusion in the Community list, and confirmed that the carrier has completed the corrective actions needed to address all safety deficiencies which led to the ban.
A number of ongoing measures, such as the introduction of new software, and the appointment of a new engineering manager and a new quality manager, are meant to prevent such anomalies to reoccur in the future.
On the basis of the common criteria, it is assessed that Mahan Air has implemented all necessary measures to conform to relevant safety standards and therefore may be withdrawn from Annex A. The Commission will continue to monitor closely the performance of the carrier.
There is verified evidence of serious safety deficiencies on the part of certain air carriers certified in the Republic of Gabon.
More than 93 % of ICAO standards were not implemented at the time of the completion of the ICAO audit.
These deficiencies have been identified by the competent authorities of France during ramp inspections performed under the SAFA programme (2).
The Commission, having regard to the results of the ICAO audit and the request of the United Kingdom, has consulted the competent authorities of Gabon on the actions undertaken by them to remedy the deficiencies observed by ICAO and by Member States.
In addition, the competent authorities of Gabon provided evidence to the Commission of the adoption of a new civil aviation code in May 2008, of the development of specific operating regulations for airworthiness and operations, and informed that the decision to establish an independent civil aviation agency (ANAC) was taken and should be promulgated in July 2008.
The competent authorities of Gabon have also informed the Commission and the Air Safety Committee that ICAO has been contracted from July 2008 and for a period of one year to assist Gabon in the development of its new civil aviation oversight system.
Einkum Ã¾aÃ° aÃ° samkvÃ¦mt flugsvÃ¦Ã°i er leyfÃ°ur rekstur Ã¡ heimsvÃ­su, jafnvel Ã¾Ã³tt lÃ¶gbÃ¦r yfirvÃ¶ld Gabon staÃ°festi aÃ° hann takmarkist viÃ° Gabon og/eÃ°a undirsvÃ¦Ã°i Ã¾ess.
The competent authorities of Gabon have indicated that they intend to clarify the situation rapidly.
Taking into account the results of ramp inspections performed at Community airports under the SAFA programme, as well as the commitment of the competent authorities of Gabon to contract external inspectors to carry out systematic ramp inspections prior to the departure of international flights to the Community and the decision of the Government of Gabon to prohibit any such flight in case safety deficiencies would be observed, the Commission considers that the operations into the Community of the remaining two air carriers, Gabon Airlines and Afrijet, should be permitted, provided that they are strictly limited to their present level with the aircraft currently used.
The Commission will continue to monitor closely the performance of these two carriers.
The Commission, in cooperation with the Member States, intends to verify the satisfactory implementation of the announced measures by means of an on-site visit in due time.
The authorities of the Kyrgyz Republic have provided the Commission with information indicating that they granted an AOC to the following air carriers: Valor Air and Artik Avia.
The authorities of the Kyrgyz Republic have provided the Commission with evidence of the withdrawal of the AOCs of the following air carriers: Botir Avia; Intal Avia; Air Central Asia.
As envisaged in recital 24 of Regulation No 331/2008 the competent authorities of the Republic of Cuba informed the Commission on 19 June 2008 that EGPWS equipment has been installed on the aircraft of type Ilyushin IL-62 with registration marks CU-T1284 and CU-T1280 of the carrier Cubana de AviaciÃ³n.
Moreover, the competent authorities of the Republic of Cuba informed the Commission that they have verified that all previously detected safety deficiencies have been efficiently addressed by that air carrier.
Member States will verify systematically the effective compliance with relevant safety standards through the prioritisation of ramp inspections to be carried out on aircraft of this carrier pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 351/2008.
These deficiencies have been identified by the competent authorities of Austria, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland, during ramp inspections performed under the SAFA programme (1).
Following the invitation of the carrier and of the competent authorities of the Islamic Republic of Iran, a team of European experts conducted a fact-finding mission from 16 to 20 June 2008 to verify the implementation by the carrier of the various corrective actions.
On the basis of the common criteria, it is assessed that Iran Air is continuously implementing all necessary measures to resolve satisfactorily all previously detected safety deficiencies in compliance with relevant safety standards.
The Commission will continue to monitor closely the performance of the carrier.
These deficiencies have been identified by the competent authorities of France, Germany, and Italy, during ramp inspections performed under the SAFA programme (1).
The carrier was audited by Airbus in these two areas in November and December 2007 and then presented a series of corrective actions to improve the safety performance and also address in a systematic way the safety deficiencies detected during ramp inspections which affected these areas.
The Commission considers that the corrective action plan does not respond satisfactorily to all identified safety problems.
A comprehensive evaluation of the action plan in this area is not possible, because of incomplete answers given by the carrier.
This documentation contains a revised corrective action plan following further discussions with Airbus.
For purposes of completion of the evaluation by the Commission and Member States of the detailed supporting documentation submitted by Yemenia, the Commission will request the company for further clarifications regarding the revision of the corrective action plan taking into account the discussions between the carrier and Airbus.
Moreover, the latest ramp inspections in the Community have not showed major deficiencies.
There is verified evidence of serious safety deficiencies on the part of all air carriers certified in Cambodia.
The competent authorities of Cambodia showed an insufficient ability to implement and enforce ICAO safety standards.
The technical and operations personnel of the State Secretariat of Civil Aviation (âSSCA) was not involved in the approval process of applicants.
Furthermore, the current airworthiness status of aircraft registered in Cambodia could not be reliably determined.
The Commission urges the SSCA to take decisive actions on the safety deficiencies, in particular with regard to the full re-certification of the operators currently licensed in Cambodia in full compliance with ICAO standards.
Air carriers from Sierra Leone
As regards the removal of all the carriers licensed in Sierra Leone, including Bellview Airlines (SL), the Commission considers that the withdrawal from Annex A is not justified, as there is no evidence that these carriers have ceased to operate.
As regards the outline of the corrective action plan sent by the competent authorities of Sierra Leone to ICAO, the Commission has not received the evidence (relevant documentation) that addresses the deficiencies on safety oversight and related standards and recommended practices on civil aviation with the dates of compliance.
The Commission received on 16 May an update on the progress of implementation of the corrective action plan by the competent authorities of Indonesia.
The Commission has also received from the competent authorities of Indonesia on 2 June 2008 information on the planning and the implementation of surveillance activities for the carriers Garuda Indonesia, Ekpres Transportasi Antar Benua, Airfast Indonesia and Mandala Airlines.
The competent authorities of Indonesia have deployed considerable efforts to redress the safety situation of their country by beginning to implement a series of comprehensive corrective actions which are currently ongoing and should be accomplished in the coming months.
The carrier Garuda Indonesia submitted on 7 May 2008 complementary information requested by the Commission during the hearing of the carrier by the Air Safety Committee on 3 April 2008 regarding the corrective actions undertaken in the areas of internal control systems and the installation of E-GPWS on the B-737 fleet.
On the basis of the common criteria, and in view of the fact that, to date, ICAO has not agreed to the closure of any of the findings raised during its audits, it is assessed that, at present, the competent authorities of Indonesia have failed to demonstrate that they have performed their regulatory and oversight responsibilities in compliance with ICAO standards with respect to all the carriers they certify.
The Commission will closely liaise with ICAO for the purpose of its assessment of the ability of the competent authorities of Indonesia to implement and enforce the international safety standards.
The carriers Airfast Indonesia, Garuda Indonesia and Mandala Airlines made individual requests to present their comments orally to the Air Safety Committee, and were subsequently heard on 9 and 10 July 2008.
Since this carrier has consequently ceased its activities, it should be withdrawn from Annex A.
The Community list should be updated accordingly and these carriers should be included in Annex A.
Since these measures have a temporary nature, the Commission considers that the withdrawal from Annex A is not justified.
The U.S. Department of Transportations Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) lowered the safety rating of the Republic of Philippines in its IASA programme, for the reason that the Republic of Philippines fails to comply with international safety standards set by ICAO.
ICAO has communicated that it will conduct in November 2008 a comprehensive inspection of the Air Transportation Office of the Republic of Philippines in the framework of the Universal Safety Oversight Audit Programme (USOAP).
The Philippines have indicated that a new Civil Aviation Authority Act has been adopted in March 2008 and that the competent authority is being restructured into a fully independent agency, which has started to operate on 7 July 2008.
The Commission considers that a decision regarding the possible inclusion of all carriers certified in the Republic of Philippines in the Community list should be deferred until the ICAO audit results are known.
Air carriers from the Russian Federation
The documentation submitted by these carriers and presentations made by the authorities with oversight responsibility permitted to clarify the safety situation of these air carriers and their compliance with ICAO standards applicable for international operations.
A revised AOC, together with the complete operations specifications will be notified to the Commission prior to any operations of such aircraft into Community airspace.
According to that decision, the following aircraft are excluded from operations into, within and out of the Community:
The competent authorities of the Russian Federation and the Commission remain committed to continue their close cooperation and to exchange all necessary information related to the safety of their air carriers.
As stated in recital 18 of Regulation No 331/2008, the carrier Ukraine Cargo Airways submitted on 1 April 2008 a revised corrective action plan reflecting the changes required by the competent authorities of Ukraine following an audit of the company.
The competent authorities of Ukraine have informed the Commission on 19 June 2008 that they are not in a position to confirm the fulfilment of corrective actions by the carrier Ukraine Cargo Airways.
The competent authorities of Ukraine confirmed their preparedness to continue comprehensive oversight of Ukraine Cargo Airways and their commitment to provide the Air Safety Committee with the complete decision regarding the effectiveness of the implementation by Ukraine Cargo Airways of its corrective action plan.
Furthermore, according to these authorities, the remaining nine aircraft had not been found compliant with the required actions ensuring implementation of ICAO standards and remained therefore under operating restrictions in Ukraine.
However, based on documentary evidence regarding the results of the verifications undertaken so far by the competent authority of Ukraine as well as the representations made to the Air Safety Committee by these authorities, it considers that the plan has not been fully implemented by the carrier as the verification by the competent authorities of Ukraine indicates a lack of appropriateness and effectiveness of the corrective actions implemented to date.
Therefore, on the basis of the common criteria, at this stage the carrier may not be withdrawn from Annex A.
As envisaged in recital 21 of Regulation No 331/2008, the Commission invited on 11 April 2008 the competent authorities of Ukraine to present by 10 May 2008 a plan of measures to enhance the exercise of safety oversight of operators under their regulatory authority and of aircraft registered in Ukraine.
The competent authorities of Ukraine submitted such a plan on 31 May 2008.
Also, the competent authorities of Ukraine submitted evidence of legislative measures which are applicable until the adoption of the new aviation code also affecting safety aspects has been enacted.
However, the effectiveness of this plan cannot be assessed at this stage, as the timetable of corrective actions extends until 2011, while most of the measures affecting oversight of continued airworthiness and maintenance should be put in place by the end of 2008.
The competent authorities of Ukraine are required to present a progress report on a 3-month basis.
Furthermore, Member States will verify systematically the effective compliance with relevant safety standards through the prioritisation of ramp inspections to be carried out on aircraft of carriers licensed in Ukraine pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 351/2008.
No evidence of the full implementation of appropriate remedial actions by the other carriers included in the Community list updated on 16 April 2008 and by the authorities with responsibility for regulatory oversight of these air carriers has been communicated to the Commission so far in spite of specific requests submitted by the latter.
The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Air Safety Committee,
Annex A is replaced by Annex A to this Regulation.
This Regulation shall enter into force on the day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
By Commission Regulation (EC) No (2) certain international standards and interpretations that were extant at 15 October 2008 were adopted.
The amendments require certain instruments issued by companies that are currently classified as liabilities despite having characteristics similar to ordinary shares, to be classified as equity.
The consultation with the Technical Expert Group (TEG) of the European Financial Reporting Advisory Group (EFRAG) confirms that the amendments to IAS 32 and IAS 1 meet the technical criteria for adoption set out in Article 3(2) of Regulation (EC) No. In accordance with Commission Decision 2006/505/EC of 14 July 2006 setting up a Standards Advice Review Group to advise the Commission on the objectivity and neutrality of the European Financial Reporting Advisory Group's (EFRAGs) opinions (3), the Standards Advice Review Group considered EFRAG's opinion on endorsement and advised the Commission that it is well balanced and objective.
The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Accounting Regulatory Committee,
International Accounting Standard (IAS) 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation is amended as set out in the Annex to this Regulation;
Each company shall apply the amendments to IAS 32 and to IAS 1, as set out in the Annex to this Regulation, at the latest, as from the commencement date of its first financial year starting after 31 December 2008.

AMENDMENTS TO IAS 32 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS: PRESENTATION AND IAS 1 PRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
This document sets out amendments to IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation and IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements (as revised in 2007) and consequential amendments to IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures, IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement and IFRIC 2 Members Shares in Co-operative Entities and Similar Instruments.
The amendments result from proposals that were contained in an exposure draft of proposed amendments to IAS 32 and IAS 1-Financial Instruments Puttable at Fair Value and Obligations Arising on Liquidation published in June 2006.
If entities apply these amendments for an earlier period, they shall disclose that fact.
DEFINITIONS (SEE ALSO PARAGRAPHS AG3âAG23)
financial asset is any asset that is:
a derivative that will or may be settled other than by the exchange of a fixed amount of cash or another financial asset for a fixed number of the entitys own equity instruments.
financial liability is any liability that is:
to exchange financial assets or financial liabilities with another entity under conditions that are potentially unfavourable to the entity; or
a non-derivative for which the entity is or may be obliged to deliver a variable number of the entitys own equity instruments; or
For this purpose the entitys own equity instruments do not include puttable financial instruments that are classified as equity instruments in accordance with paragraphs 16A and 16B, instruments that impose on the entity an obligation to deliver to another party a pro rata share of the net assets of the entity only on liquidation and are classified as equity instruments in accordance with paragraphs 16C and 16D, or instruments that are contracts for the future receipt or delivery of the entitys own equity instruments.
A puttable instrument is a financial instrument that gives the holder the right to put the instrument back to the issuer for cash or another financial asset or is automatically put back to the issuer on the occurrence of an uncertain future event or the death or retirement of the instrument holder.
After paragraph 16, a heading, paragraphs 16A and 16B, another heading, paragraphs 16C and 16D, another heading and paragraphs 16E and 16F are added.
When an issuer applies the definitions in paragraph 11 to determine whether a financial instrument is an equity instrument rather than a financial liability, the instrument is an equity instrument if, and only if, both conditions (a) and (b) below are met.
a derivative that will be settled only by the issuer exchanging a fixed amount of cash or another financial asset for a fixed number of its own equity instruments.
A contractual obligation, including one arising from a derivative financial instrument, that will or may result in the future receipt or delivery of the issuers own equity instruments, but does not meet conditions (a) and (b) above, is not an equity instrument.
It entitles the holder to a pro rata share of the entitys net assets in the event of the entitys liquidation.
A pro rata share is determined by:
multiplying that amount by the number of the units held by the financial instrument holder.
To be in such a class the instrument:
does not need to be converted into another instrument before it is in the class of instruments that is subordinate to all other classes of instruments.
For example, they must all be puttable, and the formula or other method used to calculate the repurchase or redemption price is the same for all instruments in that class.
The total expected cash flows attributable to the instrument over the life of the instrument are based substantially on the profit or loss, the change in the recognised net assets or the change in the fair value of the recognised and unrecognised net assets of the entity over the life of the instrument (excluding any effects of the instrument).
total cash flows based substantially on the profit or loss, the change in the recognised net assets or the change in the fair value of the recognised and unrecognised net assets of the entity (excluding any effects of such instrument or contract) and
For the purposes of applying this condition, the entity shall not consider non-financial contracts with a holder of an instrument described in paragraph 16A that have contractual terms and conditions that are similar to the contractual terms and conditions of an equivalent contract that might occur between a non-instrument holder and the issuing entity.
Instruments, or components of instruments, that impose on the entity an obligation to deliver to another party a pro rata share of the net assets of the entity only on liquidation
The obligation arises because liquidation either is certain to occur and outside the control of the entity (for example, a limited life entity) or is uncertain to occur but is at the option of the instrument holder.
dividing the net assets of the entity on liquidation into units of equal amount; and
the instrument has no priority over other claims to the assets of the entity on liquidation, and
All financial instruments in the class of instruments that is subordinate to all other classes of instruments must have an identical contractual obligation for the issuing entity to deliver a pro rata share of its net assets on liquidation.
the effect of substantially restricting or fixing the residual return to the instrument holders.
If the entity cannot determine that this condition is met, it shall not classify the instrument as an equity instrument.
An entity shall classify a financial instrument as an equity instrument in accordance with paragraphs 16A and 16B or paragraphs 16C and 16D from the date when the instrument has all the features and meets the conditions set out in those paragraphs.
For example, if an entity redeems all its issued non-puttable instruments and any puttable instruments that remain outstanding have all the features and meet all the conditions in paragraphs 16A and 16B, the entity shall reclassify the puttable instruments as equity instruments from the date when it redeems the non-puttable instruments.
It shall reclassify an equity instrument as a financial liability from the date when the instrument ceases to have all the features or meet the conditions in paragraphs 16A and 16B or paragraphs 16C and 16D.
The entity shall recognise in equity any difference between the carrying value of the equity instrument and the fair value of the financial liability at the date of reclassification.
An equity instrument shall be measured at the carrying value of the financial liability at the date of reclassification.
With the exception of the circumstances described in paragraphs 16A and 16B or paragraphs 16C and 16D, a critical feature in differentiating a financial liability from an equity instrument is the existence of a contractual obligation of one party to the financial instrument (the issuer) either to deliver cash or another financial asset to the other party (the holder) or to exchange financial assets or financial liabilities with the holder under conditions that are potentially unfavourable to the issuer.
Substance and legal form are commonly consistent, but not always.
a financial instrument that gives the holder the right to put it back to the issuer for cash or another financial asset (a puttable instrument) is a financial liability, except for those instruments classified as equity instruments in accordance with paragraphs 16A and 16B or paragraphs 16C and 16D.
The existence of an option for the holder to put the instrument back to the issuer for cash or another financial asset means that the puttable instrument meets the definition of a financial liability, except for those instruments classified as equity instruments in accordance with paragraphs 16A and 16B or paragraphs 16C and 16D.
However, classification as a financial liability does not preclude the use of descriptors such as ânet asset value attributable to unitholders and âchange in net asset value attributable to unitholders in the financial statements of an entity that has no contributed equity (such as some mutual funds and unit trusts, see Illustrative Example 7) or the use of additional disclosure to show that total members interests comprise items such as reserves that meet the definition of equity and puttable instruments that do not (see Illustrative Example 8).
After paragraph 22, paragraph 22A is added.
Except as stated in paragraph 22A, a contract that will be settled by the entity (receiving or) delivering a fixed number of its own equity instruments in exchange for a fixed amount of cash or another financial asset is an equity instrument.
This includes a contract that will be settled by the entity receiving or delivering a fixed number of such instruments in exchange for a fixed amount of cash or another financial asset.
This is the case even if the contract itself is an equity instrument.
The issuer of such an instrument does not have the unconditional right to avoid delivering cash or another financial asset (or otherwise to settle it in such a way that it would be a financial liability).
the part of the contingent settlement provision that could require settlement in cash or another financial asset (or otherwise in such a way that it would be a financial liability) is not genuine;
the instrument has all the features and meets the conditions in paragraphs 16A and 16B.
After paragraph 97B, paragraph 97C is added.
An entity shall apply those amendments for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009.
Puttable Financial Instruments and Obligations Arising on Liquidation introduced a limited scope exception; therefore, an entity shall not apply the exception by analogy.
The instrument shall not be considered an equity instrument under other guidance, for example IFRS 2 Share-based Payment.
If the liability component is no longer outstanding, a retrospective application of those amendments to IAS 32 would involve separating two components of equity.
The other component would represent the original equity component.
In the Appendix Application Guidance, paragraphs AG13 and AG14 are amended.
AG13 Examples of equity instruments include non-puttable ordinary shares, some puttable instruments (see paragraphs 16A and 16B), some instruments that impose on the entity an obligation to deliver to another party a pro rata share of the net assets of the entity only on liquidation (see paragraphs 16C and 16D), some types of preference shares (see paragraphs AG25 and AG26), and warrants or written call options that allow the holder to subscribe for or purchase a fixed number of non-puttable ordinary shares in the issuing entity in exchange for a fixed amount of cash or another financial asset.
However, if such a contract contains an obligation for the entity to pay cash or another financial asset (other than a contract classified as equity in accordance with paragraphs 16A and 16B or paragraphs 16C and 16D), it also gives rise to a liability for the present value of the redemption amount (see paragraph AG27(a)).
This may be the case following the declaration of a dividend or when the entity is being wound up and any assets remaining after the satisfaction of liabilities become distributable to shareholders.
Instead, any consideration paid for such a contract is deducted from equity.
AG14A One of the features of paragraphs 16A and 16C is that the financial instrument is in the class of instruments that is subordinate to all other classes.
An entity shall reassess the classification if there is a change in relevant circumstances.
AG14C An instrument that has a preferential right on liquidation of the entity is not an instrument with an entitlement to a pro rata share of the net assets of the entity.
AG14D If an entity has only one class of financial instruments, that class shall be treated as if it were subordinate to all other classes.
AG14E The total expected cash flows of the instrument over the life of the instrument must be substantially based on the profit or loss, change in the recognised net assets or fair value of the recognised and unrecognised net assets of the entity over the life of the instrument.
Transactions entered into by an instrument holder other than as owner of the entity (paragraphs 16A and 16C)
For example, an instrument holder may also be an employee of the entity.
AG14G An example is a limited partnership that has limited and general partners.
In such situations, the guarantee and the associated cash flows relate to the instrument holders in their role as guarantors and not in their roles as owners of the entity.
AG14H Another example is a profit or loss sharing arrangement that allocates profit or loss to the instrument holders on the basis of services rendered or business generated during the current and previous years.
However, profit or loss sharing arrangements that allocate profit or loss to instrument holders based on the nominal amount of their instruments relative to others in the class represent transactions with the instrument holders in their roles as owners and should be considered when assessing the features listed in paragraph 16A or paragraph 16C.
No other financial instrument or contract with total cash flows that substantially fixes or restricts the residual return to the instrument holder (paragraphs 16B and 16D)
The following instruments, when entered into on normal commercial terms with unrelated parties, are unlikely to prevent instruments that otherwise meet the criteria in paragraph 16A or paragraph 16C from being classified as equity:
instruments with total cash flows based on a percentage of revenue.
contracts requiring the payment of an insignificant percentage of profit for services rendered or goods provided.
AG27 The following examples illustrate how to classify different types of contracts on an entitys own equity instruments:
Accordingly, any consideration received or paid for such a contract is added directly to or deducted directly from equity.
However, if the contract requires the entity to purchase (redeem) its own shares for cash or another financial asset at a fixed or determinable date or on demand, the entity also recognises a financial liability for the present value of the redemption amount (with the exception of instruments that have all the features and meet the conditions in paragraphs 16A and 16B or paragraphs 16C and 16D).
An entitys obligation to purchase its own shares for cash gives rise to a financial liability for the present value of the redemption amount even if the number of shares that the entity is obliged to repurchase is not fixed or if the obligation is conditional on the counterparty exercising a right to redeem (except as stated in paragraphs 16A and 16B or paragraphs 16C and 16D).
A contract that will be settled in cash or another financial asset is a financial asset or financial liability even if the amount of cash or another financial asset that will be received or delivered is based on changes in the market price of the entitys own equity (except as stated in paragraphs 16A and 16B or paragraphs 16C and 16D).
AG29A Some types of instruments that impose a contractual obligation on the entity are classified as equity instruments in accordance with paragraphs 16A and 16B or paragraphs 16C and 16D.
This exception is not extended to the classification of non-controlling interests in the consolidated financial statements.
Presentation of Financial Statements (as revised in 2007)
The following terms are described in IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation and are used in this Standard with the meaning specified in IAS 32:
an instrument that imposes on the entity an obligation to deliver to another party a pro rata share of the net assets of the entity only on liquidation and is classified as an equity instrument (described in paragraphs 16C and 16D of IAS 32).
If an entity has reclassified
an instrument that imposes on the entity an obligation to deliver to another party a pro rata share of the net assets of the entity only on liquidation and is classified as an equity instrument
After paragraph 136, a heading and paragraph 136A are inserted.
For puttable financial instruments classified as equity instruments, an entity shall disclose (to the extent not disclosed elsewhere):
its objectives, policies and processes for managing its obligation to repurchase or redeem the instruments when required to do so by the instrument holders, including any changes from the previous period;
information about how the expected cash outflow on redemption or repurchase was determined.
the domicile and legal form of the entity, its country of incorporation and the address of its registered office (or principal place of business, if different from the registered office);
the name of the parent and the ultimate parent of the group; and
After paragraph 139A, paragraph 139B is added.
If an entity applies the amendments for an earlier period, it shall disclose that fact and apply the related amendments to IAS 32, IAS 39, IFRS 7 and IFRIC 2 Members Shares in Co-operative Entities and Similar Instruments at the same time.
This IFRS shall be applied by all entities to all types of financial instruments, except:
An entity shall apply the amendment in paragraph 3 for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009.
Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement
financial instruments issued by the entity that meet the definition of an equity instrument in IAS 32 (including options and warrants) or that are required to be classified as an equity instrument in accordance with paragraphs 16A and 16B or paragraphs 16C and 16D of IAS 32.
After paragraph 103E, paragraph 103F is added.
If an entity applies Puttable Financial Instruments and Obligations Arising on Liquidation (Amendments to IAS 32 and IAS 1), issued in February 2008, for an earlier period, the amendment in paragraph 2 shall be applied for that earlier period.
In the References section, the footnote is amended.
In February 2008 the IASB amended IAS 32 by requiring instruments to be classified as equity if those instruments have all the features and meet the conditions in paragraphs 16A and 16B or paragraphs 16C and 16D of IAS 32.
Members shares that would be classified as equity if the members did not have a right to request redemption are equity if either of the conditions described in paragraphs 7 and 8 is present or the members shares have all the features and meet the conditions in paragraphs 16A and 16B or paragraphs 16C and 16D of IAS 32.
An unconditional prohibition may be absolute, in that all redemptions are prohibited.
Members shares in excess of the prohibition against redemption are liabilities, unless the entity has the unconditional right to refuse redemption as described in paragraph 7 or the members shares have all the features and meet the conditions in paragraphs 16A and 16B or paragraphs 16C and 16D of IAS 32.
Such a change in the redemption prohibition leads to a transfer between financial liabilities and equity.
If an entity applies Puttable Financial Instruments and Obligations Arising on Liquidation (Amendments to IAS 32 and IAS 1), issued in February 2008, for an earlier period, the amendments in paragraphs 6, 9, A1 and A12 shall be applied for that earlier period.
EXAMPLES OF APPLICATION OF THE CONSENSUS
The examples do not constitute an exhaustive list; other fact patterns are possible.
A12 In this case, CU750,000 would be classified as equity and CU150,000 would be classified as financial liabilities.
a financial instrument that gives the holder the right to put it back to the issuer for cash or another financial asset (a puttable instrument) is a financial liability, except for those instruments classified as equity instruments in accordance with paragraphs 16A and 16B or paragraphs 16C and 16D.
The existence of an option for the holder to put the instrument back to the issuer for cash or another financial asset means that the puttable instrument meets the definition of a financial liability, except for those instruments classified as equity instruments in accordance with paragraphs 16A and 16B or paragraphs 16C and 16d.
on cross-border payments in the Community and repealing Regulation (EC) No
That principle of equality of charges is established by Regu lation (EC) No of the European Parliament and of the Council of 19 December 2001 on cross-border payments in euro (4), which applies to cross- border payments in euro and in Swedish kronor up to EUR 50 000, or equivalent.
The Commissions report examined the practical problems encountered in relation to the implementation of Regulation (EC) No. In conclusion, a number of amendments to that Regulation were proposed in order to address the problems identified during the review process.
Directive 2007/64/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 November 2007 on payment services in the internal market (5) provides a modern legal foundation for the creation of a Community-wide internal market for payments.
Regulation (EC) No covers cross-border credit transfers and cross-border electronic payment transactions.
The principle of equality of charges should apply to payments initiated or terminated on paper or in cash, which are processed electronically in the course of the payment execution chain, excluding cheques, and to all charges linked directly or indirectly to a payment transaction, including charges linked to a contract but excluding currency conversion charges.
In order to prevent the fragmentation of payment markets, it is appropriate to apply the principle of equality of charges.
It should be possible, inter alia, to use the following criteria to identify the national payment corresponding to a cross-border payment: the channel used to initiate, execute and terminate the payment, the degree of automation, any payment guarantee, customer status and relationship with the payment service provider, or the payment instrument used, as defined in Article 4(23) of Directive 2007/64/EC.
Competent authorities should issue guidelines to identify corresponding payments where they consider it necessary.
It is important to facilitate the execution of cross-border payments by payment service providers.
It is therefore appropriate that payment service providers provide payment service users with the IBAN and the BIC for the account in question.
In order to guarantee the continuous, timely and efficient provision of balance-of- payments statistics, it is also desirable to ensure that it remains possible to collect readily available payments data such as the IBAN, the BIC and the amount of the transaction or basic, aggregated payments data for different payment instruments if the collection process does not disrupt the automated payments processing and could be fully automated.
Currently, different business models are used for existing national direct debit schemes.
For cross-border direct debits, this could be achieved, exceptionally, by establishing a maximum amount for the multilateral interchange fee per transaction during a transitional period.
For national SEPA direct debits, the same national interchange fee or other agreed inter-bank remuneration between the payment service providers of the payee and of the payer could be used as that which existed before the date of application of this Regulation.
Where the direct debit transaction is subject to a bilateral agreement, however, the terms of such a bilateral agreement should take precedence over any multilateral interchange fee or other agreed inter-bank remuneration.
At the end of the transitional period, a long-term solution for the SEPA direct debit business model should be in place in line with EC competition law and the Community regulatory framework.
For a direct debit transaction to be executed, the payers account must be reachable.
If the payer account is not reachable under the SEPA direct debit scheme, the payer (debtor) and the payee (creditor) will be unable to benefit from the new direct debit payment opportunities available.
If creditors are not able to reach all their debtors in a single operation, additional manual intervention will be needed, which is likely to increase costs.
Given the specific features of direct debits between businesses, however, this should apply only to the SEPA core direct debit scheme and not to the SEPA business-to-business direct debit scheme.
The reachability obligation should, furthermore, not apply to payment service providers which have been authorised to provide and execute direct debit transactions but which do not engage commercially in such activities.
Payment service providers should therefore enjoy a tran sitional period of a maximum of 1 year following the date of application of this Regulation in order to comply with that obligation.
Payment service providers located in a Member State that has introduced the euro as its currency within 4 years of the date of application of this Regulation should, however, be required to comply with the reachability obligation within 1 year of the date on which the Member State concerned joined the euro area.
In order to ensure that redress is possible where this Regulation has been incorrectly applied, Member States should establish adequate and effective complaint and redress procedures for settling any dispute between the payment service user and the payment service provider.
It is essential to ensure that the competent authorities and out-of-court complaint and redress bodies, within the Community, actively cooperate for the smooth and timely resolution of cross-border disputes under this Regulation.
It is necessary that Member States lay down effective, proportionate and dissuasive penalties in national law for failure to comply with this Regulation.
In order to allow Member States which do not have the euro as their currency to extend the application of this Regulation to cross-border payments denominated in their national currency, a notification procedure should therefore be established.
It is desirable that the Commission present a report on the appropriateness of removing settlement-based national reporting obligations.
In the context of the development of SEPA, it is also desirable that such a report assess the appropriateness of the ceiling of EUR 50 000, which currently applies to the principle of equality of charges.

on standard contractual clauses for the transfer of personal data to processors established in third countries under Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council
Having regard to Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data (1), and in particular Article 26(4) thereof,
Pursuant to Directive 95/46/EC Member States are required to provide that a transfer of personal data to a third country may only take place if the third country in question ensures an adequate level of data protection and the Member States laws, which comply with the other provisions of the Directive, are respected prior to the transfer.
Such safeguards may in particular result from appropriate contractual clauses.
The Working Party on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data established under that Directive has issued guidelines to aid with the assessment.
Therefore, the data exporter and the data importer are free to include any other clauses on business related issues which they consider as being pertinent for the contract as long as they do not contradict the standard contractual clauses.
This Decision should only have the effect of requiring the Member States not to refuse to recognise, as providing adequate safeguards, the standard contractual clauses set out in it and should not therefore have any effect on other contractual clauses.
Much experience has been gained since the adoption of Decision 2002/16/EC.
In addition, stakeholders have submitted proposals with a view to updating the standard contractual clauses set out in Decision 2002/16/EC in order to take account of the rapidly expanding scope of data-processing activities in the world and to address some issues that were not covered by that Decision (4).
This Decision should not apply to the transfer of personal data by controllers established in the European Union to controllers established outside the European Union which fall within the scope of Commission Decision 2001/497/EC of 15 June 2001 on standard contractual clauses for the transfer of personal data to third countries, under Directive 95/46/EC (1).
However, some of the standard contractual clauses, in particular as regards the data exporters obligations, should be included in order to increase clarity as to the provisions which may be contained in a contract between a controller and a processor.
In exceptional cases where data exporters refuse or are unable to instruct the data importer properly, with an imminent risk of grave harm to the data subjects, the standard contractual clauses should allow the supervisory authorities to audit data importers and sub-processors and, where appropriate, take decisions which are binding on data importers and sub-processors.
Standard contractual clauses should provide for the technical and organisational security measures to be applied by data processors established in a third country not providing adequate protection, in order to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risks represented by the processing and the nature of the data to be protected.
In order to facilitate data flows from the European Union, it is desirable for processors providing data-processing services to several data controllers in the European Union to be allowed to apply the same technical and organisational security measures irrespective of the Member State from which the data transfer originates, in particular in those cases where the data importer receives data for further processing from different establishments of the data exporter in the European Union, in which case the law of the designated Member State of establishment should apply.
Member States should retain the power to particularise the information the parties are required to provide.
The data importer should process the transferred personal data only on behalf of the data exporter and in accordance with his instructions and the obligations contained in the clauses.
The data exporter should instruct the data importer throughout the duration of the data-processing services to process the data in accordance with his instructions, the applicable data protection laws and the obligations contained in the clauses.
This Decision should contain specific standard contractual clauses on the sub-processing by a data processor established in a third country (the data importer) of his processing services to other processors (sub-processors) established in third countries.
In addition, the sub-processing should only consist of the operations agreed in the contract between the data exporter and the data importer incorporating the standard contractual clauses provided for in this Decision and should not refer to different processing operations or purposes so that the purpose limitation principle set out by Directive 95/46/EC is respected.
The transfer of personal data to processors established outside the European Union should not prejudice the fact that the processing activities should be governed by the applicable data protection law.
The data subject should be entitled to take action and, where appropriate, receive compensation from the data exporter who is the data controller of the personal data transferred.
Exceptionally, the data subject should be also entitled to take action, and, where appropriate, receive compensation from a sub-processor in those situations where both the data exporter and the data importer have factually disappeared or ceased to exist in law or have become insolvent.
In the event of a dispute between a data subject, who invokes the third-party beneficiary clause, and the data importer, which is not amicably resolved, the data importer should offer the data subject a choice between mediation or litigation.
The contract should be governed by the law of the Member State in which the data exporter is established enabling a third-party beneficiary to enforce a contract.
The same law should also govern the provisions on data protection of any contract with a sub-processor for the sub-processing of the processing activities of the personal data transferred by the data exporter to the data importer under the contractual clauses.
The Working Party on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data established under Article 29 of Directive 95/46/EC has delivered an opinion on the level of protection provided under the standard contractual clauses annexed to this Decision, which has been taken into account in the preparation of this Decision.
The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee established under Article 31 of Directive 95/46/EC,
This Decision concerns only the adequacy of protection provided by the standard contractual clauses set out in the Annex for the transfer of personal data to processors.
This Decision shall apply to the transfer of personal data by controllers established in the European Union to recipients established outside the territory of the European Union who act only as processors.
âspecial categories of data means the data referred to in Article 8 of Directive 95/46/EC;
âdata exporter means the controller who transfers the personal data;
âsub-processor means any processor engaged by the data importer or by any other sub-processor of the data importer and who agrees to receive from the data importer or from any other sub-processor of the data importer personal data exclusively intended for the processing activities to be carried out on behalf of the data exporter after the transfer in accordance with the data exporters instructions, the standard contractual clauses set out in the Annex, and the terms of the written contract for sub-processing;
âtechnical and organisational security measures means those measures aimed at protecting personal data against accidental or unlawful destruction or accidental loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure or access, in particular where the processing involves the transmission of data over a network, and against all other unlawful forms of processing.
a competent authority has established that the data importer or a sub-processor has not respected the standard contractual clauses in the Annex; or
The prohibition or suspension pursuant to paragraph 1 shall be lifted as soon as the reasons for the suspension or prohibition no longer exist.
The Commission shall evaluate the operation of this Decision on the basis of available information three years after its adoption.
It shall include any evidence that could affect the evaluation concerning the adequacy of the standard contractual clauses in the Annex and any evidence that this Decision is being applied in a discriminatory way.
Decision 2002/16/EC is repealed with effect from 15 May 2010.
Where contracting parties decide to make changes in this regard or subcontract the processing operations that are the subject matter of the contract they shall be required to enter into a new contract which shall comply with the standard contractual clauses set out in the Annex.

HAVE AGREED on the following Contractual Clauses (the Clauses) in order to adduce adequate safeguards with respect to the protection of privacy and fundamental rights and freedoms of individuals for the transfer by the data exporter to the data importer of the personal data specified in Appendix 1.
âthe data exporter means the controller who transfers the personal data;
Parties may reproduce definitions and meanings contained in Directive 95/46/EC within this Clause if they considered it better for the contract to stand alone.
âthe applicable data protection law means the legislation protecting the fundamental rights and freedoms of individuals and, in particular, their right to privacy with respect to the processing of personal data applicable to a data controller in the Member State in which the data exporter is established;
The data subject can enforce against the data exporter this Clause, Clause 4(b) to (i), Clause 5(a) to (e), and (g) to (j), Clause 6(1) and (2), Clause 7, Clause 8(2), and Clauses 9 to 12 as third-party beneficiary.
Such third-party liability of the sub-processor shall be limited to its own processing operations under the Clauses.
Obligations of the data exporter
that the processing, including the transfer itself, of the personal data has been and will continue to be carried out in accordance with the relevant provisions of the applicable data protection law (and, where applicable, has been notified to the relevant authorities of the Member State where the data exporter is established) and does not violate the relevant provisions of that State;
that the data importer will provide sufficient guarantees in respect of the technical and organisational security measures specified in Appendix 2 to this contract;
that it will ensure compliance with the security measures;
to forward any notification received from the data importer or any sub-processor pursuant to Clause 5(b) and Clause 8(3) to the data protection supervisory authority if the data exporter decides to continue the transfer or to lift the suspension;
that, in the event of sub-processing, the processing activity is carried out in accordance with Clause 11 by a sub-processor providing at least the same level of protection for the personal data and the rights of data subject as the data importer under the Clauses; and that it will ensure compliance with Clause 4(a) to (i).
The data importer agrees and warrants:
that it has no reason to believe that the legislation applicable to it prevents it from fulfilling the instructions received from the data exporter and its obligations under the contract and that in the event of a change in this legislation which is likely to have a substantial adverse effect on the warranties and obligations provided by the Clauses, it will promptly notify the change to the data exporter as soon as it is aware, in which case the data exporter is entitled to suspend the transfer of data and/or terminate the contract;
Mandatory requirements of the national legislation applicable to the data importer which do not go beyond what is necessary in a democratic society on the basis of one of the interests listed in Article 13(1) of Directive 95/46/EC, that is, if they constitute a necessary measure to safeguard national security, defence, public security, the prevention, investigation, detection and prosecution of criminal offences or of breaches of ethics for the regulated professions, an important economic or financial interest of the State or the protection of the data subject or the rights and freedoms of others, are not in contradiction with the standard contractual clauses.
that it will promptly notify the data exporter about:
any accidental or unauthorised access; and
to deal promptly and properly with all inquiries from the data exporter relating to its processing of the personal data subject to the transfer and to abide by the advice of the supervisory authority with regard to the processing of the data transferred;
that the processing services by the sub-processor will be carried out in accordance with Clause 11;
If a data subject is not able to bring a claim for compensation in accordance with paragraph 1 against the data exporter, arising out of a breach by the data importer or his sub-processor of any of their obligations referred to in Clause 3 or in Clause 11, because the data exporter has factually disappeared or ceased to exist in law or has become insolvent, the data importer agrees that the data subject may issue a claim against the data importer as if it were the data exporter, unless any successor entity has assumed the entire legal obligations of the data exporter by contract of by operation of law, in which case the data subject can enforce its rights against such entity.
The liability of the sub-processor shall be limited to its own processing operations under the Clauses.
to refer the dispute to mediation, by an independent person or, where applicable, by the supervisory authority;
The parties agree that the choice made by the data subject will not prejudice its substantive or procedural rights to seek remedies in accordance with other provisions of national or international law.
The parties agree that the supervisory authority has the right to conduct an audit of the data importer, and of any sub-processor, which has the same scope and is subject to the same conditions as would apply to an audit of the data exporter under the applicable data protection law.
In such a case the data exporter shall be entitled to take the measures foreseen in Clause 5(b).
The parties undertake not to vary or modify the Clauses.
The data importer shall not subcontract any of its processing operations performed on behalf of the data exporter under the Clauses without the prior written consent of the data exporter.
Where the sub-processor fails to fulfil its data protection obligations under such written agreement the data importer shall remain fully liable to the data exporter for the performance of the sub-processors obligations under such agreement.
This requirement may be satisfied by the sub-processor co-signing the contract entered into between the data exporter and the data importer under this Decision.
The list shall be available to the data exporters data protection supervisory authority.
The parties agree that on the termination of the provision of data-processing services, the data importer and the sub-processor shall, at the choice of the data exporter, return all the personal data transferred and the copies thereof to the data exporter or shall destroy all the personal data and certify to the data exporter that it has done so, unless legislation imposed upon the data importer prevents it from returning or destroying all or part of the personal data transferred.
The data importer and the sub-processor warrant that upon request of the data exporter and/or of the supervisory authority, it will submit its data-processing facilities for an audit of the measures referred to in paragraph 1.
